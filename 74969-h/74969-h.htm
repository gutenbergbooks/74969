<h3 class='c002'><span class='c012'>CHAPTER I</span><br> The Marionette—Its Family Tree</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>This is the family tree of the marionette. Its roots
are deep in the life of ancient Egypt, India, Persia,
China, Japan, and Java. Its great trunk springs from
the soil of Greece and Rome. Its branches spread
over Europe and reach to America.</p>

<p class='c014'>Long ago, in Egypt, there were little carved figures
of wood and ivory with limbs that could be made to
move by the pulling of strings. We do not know for
what use these little figures were intended. They may
have been the very first dolls in the world or they
may have been little images of the great gods which
the people of that country worshiped. We do know,
however, that they were treasured, and were buried
with the kings and queens of ancient Egypt in their
tombs near the banks of the Nile. Some people tell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>us that the great idols in the Egyptian temples were
puppets and that the priests concealing themselves
inside their bodies could make them move their hands
and open their mouths. This so amazed many of the
people who saw them that they fell down and worshiped
them.</p>

<p class='c014'>Imagine a very long avenue with a row of carved
stone figures called sphinxes on either side, leading
all the way up to a great temple. Imagine a slowly
moving procession of a hundred priests on its way
to the temple to do honor to the great god Osiris.
These priests are carrying a colossal golden boat on
their shoulders. But more wonderful than the temple
with its lotus-flower columns and its beautiful colors,
more wonderful than the golden boat carried by
these white-robed priests, was a marvelously made
statue of the god Osiris, which rode in the golden
boat. It moved its head constantly from side to side.
The priests knew which way it wished to go by the
way it turned its head. This figure of the god was a
marionette. We also know that the ancient Egyptians
had miniature puppet stages. One has been unearthed
which has doors of ivory with the rods and wires still
in their places. Among the Egyptian puppets that
have been found was one of a crocodile. Its lower
jaw moves on a pivot and its feet are connected with
a kind of hinge.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>INDIA</h4>

<p class='c016'>It is possible that India rather than Egypt may
have been the first home of puppets. The people of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>India believed that puppets lived with the gods long
before they came down to this world. There is a story
of Parvati, wife of the god Siva, that tells of a puppet
which she made, that was so beautiful that she was
afraid to let her husband see it, she carried it away
secretly, to the Malaya Mountains. But Siva suspected
his wife and followed her. When Siva saw the
beauty of the puppet that she was trying to hide
from him, he fell in love with it, and brought it to life.</p>

<p class='c014'>Another story is told in India about a basket of
wonderful wooden dolls that was given to a little
princess. These dolls were made in such a way that
when the princess touched a small wooden peg one
would run and bring her a cool drink, another would
fly through the air and return with a wreath of
flowers, still another could dance and one could even
talk. Sometimes, when puppets were made to represent
the gods, they were made of pure gold and birds
that could talk were placed in their mouths.</p>

<p class='c014'>The fame of these wonderful Indian puppets
reached Persia and Turkey, China and Burma, Siam
and Java, in each of which countries the puppets
were different and different kinds of temples and
theaters were made for them. Even the elephants
carved for them to ride upon were different in each
country.</p>

<p class='c014'>In many eastern countries there were two kinds
of marionettes: the round kind that we know and
another thin, flat kind called “Shadows.” No one
seems to know just when the first shadow figures
were made. An old legend says they came from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>time when all that the people saw of the religious
ceremonies was the shadow of the priest on the walls
of the sacred tent.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CHINA</h4>

<p class='c016'>We do not know just when the earliest travelers
brought puppets from India to China and Japan.
There is a legend that an old Chinese ruler who lived
more than three thousand years ago invited a famous
showman to bring his marionettes to the royal palace.
This invitation delighted the showman whose name
was Yen Sze. In fact, he was so anxious to please the
king and his wives that he made his puppet courtiers
smile at the royal ladies, which so stirred the old
king’s jealousy that he ordered Yen Sze’s head cut
off. Poor Yen Sze had to tear his puppets to pieces to
make the angry old ruler believe they were not real
people.</p>

<p class='c014'>Another story of Chinese puppets is one that comes
from the old city of Ping at the time it was besieged
by a great warrior and his army. It happened
that the king of Ping had a very crafty adviser.
This adviser told the king to send for his chief
marionette maker and order him to make a very
large and beautiful marionette, one that could dance
on the walls of the city, and this the king did. When
the wives of the soldiers of the besieging army saw
the beauty and grace of this marionette dancer, they
became so jealous that they made their husbands
give up the siege and march away at once.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is always interesting to see how human puppets
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>are, no matter when or where you find them. In
China, some were aristocrats and lived at Court with
the Emperor and the royal family. They wore beautiful
robes and gave a great deal of thought to their
speech and manners. Others were very religious and
lived with the priests in the temples; still others
seemed to have liked the out of doors, to travel and
to meet and to please the common people, and to be
very much like them in all their thoughts and ways.
When these plebeian marionettes traveled, they took
little with them for they were poor and had few
clothes and possessions. This made travel very easy.
Sometimes a small box would hold the stage, properties,
and all the puppets.</p>

<p class='c014'>The master of the puppets stood inside a blue cloth
sack when he gave his play. These traveling puppets
were apt to be rough and ready. They loved to make
the people laugh, but best of all they loved to please
the children. They gave plays about everyday life,
about animals that could talk, and about great
Chinese heroes. They touched the hearts of the
people.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>PERSIA</h4>

<p class='c016'>Puppets have helped even to make friends out of
enemies, as you may see in this old Persian story.
One day, a puppet play was being given before the
Emperor Ogotai. In this play the showman thought
he would please His Majesty by showing him some
of his enemies, the Chinese, being dragged along tied
to the tails of horses. Instead of pleasing the Emperor,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>this cruelty greatly distressed him. He ordered
the showman to come to his palace. When the showman
came, the Emperor showed him many beautiful
things that had been made by Chinese and Persian
artists, explaining to the showman that both the
Chinese and Persian people loved beautiful things.
He endeavored to make the showman understand
that if he had respect for the art of the Chinese
people, he could not be their enemy.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>JAPAN</h4>

<p class='c016'>From China puppets traveled to Japan where the
children still hear the story of the old emperor who
ordered his best showman to travel from temple to
temple for he knew that the gods would be entertained
by his wonderful marionette plays. Because
they made their puppets entertain the gods as well
as the people, may be the reason that the Japanese
have become more expert in making puppets than
any other people. Japanese marionettes move their
hands and their fingers and can even lift their eyebrows
to show scorn and surprise. The costumes for
Japanese marionettes have always been of the richest
silks and brocades. Special thought is given to embroidering
the designs on their costumes. Sometimes
their gowns are covered with jewels. When a marionette
has a beautiful new gown, a boy comes forward
and holds a light just in front of the marionette, so
that the audience can plainly see how beautiful the
costume is.</p>

<p class='c014'>The great poets of Japan have written more than a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>thousand plays for marionettes. In these plays the
Japanese puppets do just the same things that Japanese
people do. They have gardens and enjoy walking
in them. The old ladies water the flowers, the young
women play the kotes; the puppet children dance and
play games, the boys fly kites, the girls carry dolls.
The Japanese puppets are very silent little people.
They do not talk, they simply act. There are specially
trained people who read and chant their plays, and
still others who are trained to play the musical instruments
that accompany them.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>GREECE</h4>

<p class='c016'>In the old Greek cities puppets were very much at
home. They interested the older people as much as
they interested the children. Puppets were taken to
banquet tables and made to act. Such cities as Athens
and Ephesus were rivals in the art of making them.</p>

<p class='c014'>Greek boys and girls, instead of going to the movies,
went to wonderful marionette shows. These were
given in the public square, in the theaters, and even
in the temples. The marionettes used in these plays
could bend their heads, turn their eyes, and move
their hands as though they were alive. This need not
surprise us, because in those days, great engineers and
mathematicians planned their mechanism. You probably
remember the story of Archimedes, who burned
the ships that came to attack his city of Syracuse by
the use of concave mirrors. This great Archimedes, it
is said, made such a wonderful marionette that it
seemed to move of itself. One of the old Greek plays
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>showed a temple in which there stood a puppet god
with small figures dancing about it, and a fountain
that, by means of weights and measures, jetted forth
milk.</p>

<p class='c014'>The best of the Greek puppet plays seem to have
been taken from the Iliad and the Odyssey of Homer.
In a play of five scenes, one scene showed the seashore,
with men hammering, sawing, and building
ships, a second showed the men launching their boats,
a third showed the coming of a storm on the sea, the
fourth showed the ships being driven toward the rocks,
the last scene showed the wreck of the ships and the
drowning of Ajax.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ROME</h4>

<p class='c016'>Since the Romans seem to have copied so much
from the Greeks, it is not surprising that they copied
the Greek marionettes. In fact, the Romans and
Greeks seem to have been equally fond of them.
Roman writers mentioned them in their books,
Roman Emperors filled their palaces with showmen
and their puppets, and built small, richly furnished
theaters for them. Roman marionettes were sometimes
covered with gold and silver, precious stuffs, and
shining armor. Their mechanism was amazing. Almost
every sort of transformation could be carried
out. At one time, Roman rulers became so interested
in puppets that affairs of the government were almost
forgotten.</p>

<p class='c014'>There were three kinds of Roman marionettes.
The simplest kind was the Burattini, a kind of marionette
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>that is much like a mitten. They were shown
on the street corners by a showman who needed no
more than two—one for each hand. It cost almost
nothing to see them. The shopkeepers, gladiators,
slaves, and surely the Roman children came to look
whenever they heard the showman’s fife. He would
make them act droll little dialogues or pretend to sing
popular songs. There was another kind called Fantoccini.
These were jointed dolls strung on cords that
were drawn across the knees of the operator. He usually
sang or played some musical instrument while
he made certain movements with his legs that caused
the puppets to advance or retire or to move all in one
direction. A third kind of marionette was manipulated
by strings or wires from above.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the tomb of the tragic Empress Marie, wife of
the Emperor Honorius, who lived 365 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, were found
the puppets of her little child. She probably cared
more for these puppets than for all her jewels. The
great Antiochus, when he became king of Syria, surrounded
himself with mimes, burattini, and showmen,
seemingly caring little for his huge empire.</p>

<p class='c014'>When Rome fell, the gods and temples were destroyed
and puppets were almost forgotten. But we
find the world could not live long without them.
In a very short time, when the early Christians
wished to help each other to picture the precious
story of the Christ, they again began to make puppets.
We must now try to picture them in the great
underground cities that we call catacombs—probably
living in what were the world’s first churches,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>and enacting for these persecuted peoples the scenes
of the new religion. We know that these early Christians
revered them, for they carved them on their
tombs.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was before the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem
that the greatest of the early passion plays were given
by marionettes, plays so simple and religious that
they were greatly loved by the devout pilgrims who
came to that sacred shrine. It was here that puppets
were probably seen by the first crusaders who, no
doubt, had much to tell of them when they returned
to their far-distant homes. Puppets lived in the
churches, just as they once had lived in the temples.
The plays they gave were called Mysteries. These
puppet mystery plays were to be seen in both the
churches and the monasteries of all medieval Europe.
They were solemn festivals of sacred commemoration.
Into the naves and chapels of these early churches,
large wooden stages were built, carpets were spread
on the floors, tapestries were hung on the walls. At
the back of these stages, evergreen trees were placed
and in front of the trees there were stones. These
were covered with plants and moss in imitation of
the hills and valleys and pathways of the Holy Land.
Everything was so arranged that these marionettes
could give the most dramatic scenes in the life of
Christ. The little figures were carved from wood,
colored to life, richly clothed, adapted by mechanisms
so that their limbs could be made to move by the
action of springs and levers.</p>

<p class='c014'>As time went on the people seemed to lose much of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>their strong religious fervor. Marionettes did the
same. Finally almost ceasing to be religious they
became interested only in entertaining people. At
last Savonarola banished them from the churches of
Florence, and in the year 1550 the Council of Trent
tried to banish all marionettes from the churches.
The Council did this because it felt that marionettes
were very irreligious.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then the puppets rebelled and forsook the church
for the theater. Thereupon they were accused of
witchcraft and magic, were tortured, burned, beheaded,
and even buried alive. All this was done in
the XVIth Century. But all these indignities did not
drive the marionettes far from the churches. They
established themselves just outside the church
grounds. Here they were sure to be on the days when
crowds of people were coming to the great church
celebrations. The plays they gave were episodes
taken from the Holy Scriptures. These episodes
taken from the miracles came to be known as Miracle
Plays, and these plays became even more popular
than the Mystery Plays that had been given inside
the churches.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sometimes puppets received invitations to visit
great knights and ladies in their castles. They were
eager for such invitations because they enjoyed the
experiences of traveling. As always happens in travel,
they saw new things to interest them and met new
people, many of whom were quite different from their
earlier and more serious-minded friends. They enjoyed
the life of the castle, the songs of the wandering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>minstrels, and the heroic stories that the traveling
bards told in the evenings about the fire in the great
halls. They liked the noble lords and ladies, their
speech and manners and dress. These marionettes
became what you might call aristocrats.</p>

<p class='c014'>The marionettes that were religious found a home
in the quiet of the monasteries. They were the marionettes
that were scholarly and were interested in Latin
plays as well as in the Mysteries and Sacred Dramas.</p>

<p class='c014'>The greater number of marionettes preferred to
live in the towns with the common people and to
know what was going on. These puppets were full of
health and good humor. It was this sort of marionette
who changed his name and his character almost
everywhere he went. If he were in Naples, he was Scaramuccia;
in Venice, he was Messer Pantaleone; in
Bergamo, he was Arlequino; in France, he was Guignol
or Polichinello; in Germany, he was Hans Wurst
and Kaspare; in Holland, he was Jean Pickel Herring;
and in England, he was Mr. Punch.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ITALY</h4>

<p class='c016'>In Italy at about this time every kind of marionette
was very popular. Especially popular were the
Burattini. These little figures consisted of a head
and two hands held together by a large cloak within
which was hidden the hand of the manipulator, who
made the puppet act by the movements of his fingers
and wrist. The curious word, Burattini, possibly came
from a kind of coarse, durable cloth of bright colors
known as Burato, which was used for clothing this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>type of puppet. One of these Burattini was called
Arleechino. He was a great baby and played the part
of a servant. His dress was made from triangles of
red, blue, yellow, and violet pieces of Burato cloth.
He wore a small hat that scarcely covered his head.
His little shoes had no soles. Michael Angelo, it is said,
did not like his head and face. He remodeled them to
suit the Burattini’s character, which was an odd
mixture of ignorance, ingenuity, stupidity, and grace.
Listen to his speech: “Kind sir, I know that you are
in want of a servant, after having made 327 changes
in a year, and I hope to make up the round number.
I am a man who knows how to do everything—eating,
drinking, sleeping, and making love to the maids.
The only fault I have is that I do not like work. I
shall be as punctual as an idler, as faithful as a domestic
thief, as secret as an earthquake, and as watchful
as a cat. As to my honesty, surely no man can call
me a thief, but rather a clever mathematician who
finds things before their masters lose them.”</p>

<p class='c014'>You may like to know how marionettes came by
their name. One day, in the year 944, in the city of
Venice, twelve beautiful maidens went forth from
their homes to marry twelve young men at the church
of Santa Maria della Salute. Suddenly a band of
Barbary pirates landed near the church, attacked the
crowd, and in the confusion that arose, carried away
the maidens. In a short time the young men of Venice
recovered from the shock, jumped into their ships,
followed and overtook the pirates. After much fighting,
they rescued the brides. From that very day it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>was the custom in Venice to celebrate the anniversary
of this event by a great festival. Always on the last
day of the festival came the marriage of twelve
beautiful young women to twelve handsome young
men. The wedding gowns and doweries were provided
by the state from the public treasury. In the course
of time, this led to so much jealousy and so many
quarrels among the young men and women of Venice,
that the city decided to substitute life-sized wooden
dolls for the maidens. By and by, the Venetian toy
makers began to make little figures that were exactly
like the large figures, to sell as toys for the
children. These were called “little maries” or “marionettes.”</p>

<p class='c014'>When one learns to know the people of Italy, he
can easily understand how puppets might feel more
at home there than in any other country in the world.
The Italian people love music and color and motion
and life, above all else they love heroes, their great
adventures and romances. All these things are
equally dear to the hearts of the marionettes. They repay
the sympathy of the Italian people by keeping
alive for them their great heroes and hero tales.
The people might have forgotten many of their great
stories had it not been for the puppets. The legend of
the Court of Charlemagne, the story of golden-haired
Roland, which Taillefer sang before William of Normandy
at the Battle of Hastings, have been acted by
puppets in Italy for more than three hundred years.
One may still see all the characters that were in the
story as it was told in the Xth Century. There is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>Rinaldo of Montauban, his horse Bayard, his sword
Flamberge, Malagigi, the magician, and Ganelon,
the traitor, fair Clarissa and Charlemagne himself.
Italian boys and girls learn much of their history
from puppets. Sometimes it requires a whole year to
give one of their great plays like <cite>Orlando Furioso</cite>
or the story of the seven Paladins. From Italy
marionettes traveled to all the other countries of
Europe, to France, Spain, Germany, and England.
Finally they came to the United States.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>FRANCE</h4>

<p class='c016'>You may wish to know how puppets found their
way from Italy to France. There were two brothers,
Giovanni and Francesco Briocchi. Francesco was a
skilful wood carver and mechanic. Giovanni was very
clever with his speeches and jokes. As children, they
loved marionettes. They hardly knew which they enjoyed
more, sitting in the audience watching the
play, or standing behind the stage watching their
friends manipulate the puppets. They decided that
when they grew up they would be puppeteers, make
their own puppets and travel from town to town
and to the fair land of which they had heard so many
interesting tales. This they did. Giovanni made the
figures skilfully and dressed them beautifully. Francesco
made them say and do such clever and amusing
things that their fame went before them into small
towns and into the large cities. When they had made
enough money they said, “Now we can go to France.
We can easily carry our little stage and puppets on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>our backs. We can earn our way by giving plays.”
This they did, to the delight of all who saw them.
Finally they reached the city of Paris. In those days
great fairs were held where people came to buy and
sell and to make merry. Here was just the place for
Giovanni and Francesco. When the fairs became
permanent the brothers decided to settle down and
make a real home for their marionettes. This at first
was a simple kind of theater, but later came to have
every beautiful thing that French taste and ingenuity
could provide. One day the king and queen made them
a visit and engaged them to come out to their
beautiful château at St. Germain en Laye and give
puppet plays for their young son, the dauphin, and
his friends. In the records of France you may still
see the account as it stands: “Sept. 1669, to Jean
Briocchi, divertir les enfants de France, 1365 livres.”
When the Frenchmen saw the success of the Italian
showmen, they, too, began to make puppets and to
take them to the places where people gathered who
might be willing to spend a few sous for entertainment.
Among these was an old dentist, who found it
difficult to earn a living. He made some marionettes
and a clever little boxlike stage with a curtain about
it. It was just large enough for him to stand inside
and manipulate the puppets. He decided to take his
stand to the Pont Neuf, one of the principal bridges
of Paris. Here he would pull teeth when anyone
needed his services and for the rest of the time would
entertain the people. He had also a very celebrated
monkey, called Fagotin, that he knew would attract
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>a crowd. Fagotin he dressed as a sentry, gave him a
sword, and trained him to march up and down in
front of the little puppet booth. One day a great poet,
whose name was Cyrano de Bergerac, was crossing
the bridge and stopped, as did most of the people, to
see Fagotin and the puppets. It happened that the
poet had a very large nose and was a very sensitive
person. When he saw Fagotin marching up and
down and making grimaces, he thought he must
surely be making fun of his large nose. At this, the
poet was so angry that he challenged him to a duel.
Poor little Fagotin drew his sword with the air of a
master of the foils, only to be slain by the irate
poet.</p>

<p class='c014'>The French people, like the Italians, had a great
many heroes celebrated in song and romance. It
certainly would have been poor taste on the part of
the Italian puppets to have overlooked this. In a short
time the puppets forgot Italy and were at home in
many new rôles of French literature. New plays were
written for them. When that great struggle, the
French Revolution, came, the puppets took sides.
Some were on the side of the poor starving people,
others were unwilling to give up their lives of ease
and luxury. During the Reign of Terror many puppets
were beheaded. In fact, while one group of people
was beheading King Louis XVI and his queen,
Marie Antoinette, another group in almost the same
place was beheading poor Punchinello. Many puppets,
however, survived, and a whole book might
be written about the history of puppets in France
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>and the great men and women who have loved
them.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>SPAIN</h4>

<p class='c016'>In Spain, the puppets first appeared in the
churches, presenting great scenes from the Bible.
At first their garments were simple and beautiful,
but later they were so bejeweled and vulgar that they
offended the good taste of the people and the puppets
were driven out. Spain is the only country in which a
marionette was ever made a citizen and baptized.
Don Quixote saw them, and the great Emperor
Charles V, in his retirement in the monastery of
Cremona, spent many days with the famous scholar,
Torriani, making puppet soldiers and bull fighters,
with such skill that they were really able to fight.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ENGLAND</h4>

<p class='c016'>As in almost all other countries, the earliest English
puppets were those which gave religious plays in
the churches. From the churches, they went out
among the people, still giving plays founded on the
Bible stories and the lives of the saints. These plays
were combinations of shadowgraph and marionette,
and the English people sometimes called them
“motions.” English puppets were also very fond of
going to the fairs. Here is the pamphlet of a play
given at the Fair of St. Bartholomew in 1641: “Here
a knave in a fool’s coat, with a trumpet sounding or
a drum beating, invites you to see his puppets. Here
a rogue, like a wild woodman, or in antic shape like
an incubus, desires your company to see his motion.”</p>
<div  class='figcenter id001'>

<p><i>Marionette play, "Men of Iron," given by ninth year pupils, Fairmount Junior High School, Cleveland, Ohio</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>Probably the most popular puppet play in England
in those days was one called “The Old Creation of
the world, with the addition of Noah’s Flood.” The
best scene showed “Noah and his family coming out
of the ark with all the animals, two by two, and all
the fowls of the air seen in prospect sitting upon trees;
likewise, over the ark is the sun rising in a glorious
manner, moreover, a multitude of angels in a double
rank, the angels ringing bells. Likewise, machines
descending from above, double, with Dives rising
out of hell and Lazarus seen in Abraham’s bosom; besides
several dancing gigs, sarabands and country
dances, with merry conceits of Squire Punch and Sir
John Spendall.”</p>

<p class='c014'>This play was given for fifty-two successive nights.
Mr. Powell, the clever but roguish fellow who owned
these puppets, once set up his little theater just outside
the colonnades of Covent Garden, opposite the
parish church of St. Paul. He began his plays at the
sound of the church bells, and was successful in diverting
so many from the church services that he was
severely reproved by the churchmen. It was this same
clever Powell, who had a very famous puppet called
Lady Jane, who went to Paris every month and came
back with a trunk full of gowns of the latest fashion.
These marionette style shows delighted all the ladies
of fashion in London, including the queen.</p>

<p class='c014'>About 1642, all regular theaters were abolished in
England, but marionette theaters were not included.
You can scarcely imagine the good fortune this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>meant for them, for they inherited everything that
had belonged to the great theaters, all the music and
opera, the dramas, the tragedies, and the comedies.</p>

<p class='c014'>When news of this reached Italy and France, many
showmen started at once for England. They knew
they could gather pennies on the way from almost
every pocket. The regular price of these puppet
plays was but two pence, but a fine play like <cite>The
Gun Powder Plot</cite> cost eighteen pence. There were
plays about giants and fairies, about Robin Hood and
Little John, about St. George and the dragon, and
a hundred other tales.</p>

<p class='c014'>All the great writers of those days now began to
write plays for marionettes. Beautiful new theaters
were built for them. It became the fashion to go to
puppet plays. Ben Jonson says that many great ladies
went every day.</p>

<p class='c014'>In 1688, Punchinello changed his name to Mr.
Punch and he married Judy. When they had a son
and went to housekeeping, then the quarrels began.
You may have had the pleasure of hearing some of
them. Punch had a wide circle of friends and some of
them were interested in politics. Many great Englishmen,
like Addison, Steele, Fielding, Milton, and
Byron, were glad to tell him what to say that would
help to set the people thinking. Some of the English
puppets disliked cities and were only happy when
they were going up and down the lovely English
roads, traveling among the villages and country
people. There you can still find them.</p>

<p class='c014'>To-day the most beautiful English puppets are being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>made by Mr. William Simmonds who began his
work with puppet plays for village children. Mr.
Simmonds manipulates his own puppets as he cleverly
improvises songs, dances, and pantomimes.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>GERMANY—AUSTRIA—RUSSIA</h4>

<p class='c016'>Before we follow marionettes to our own country,
we ought to take a little time to see them in Germany,
Austria, and Russia. These peoples were skilful in
wood carving and made their puppets beautifully.
Marionettes were used in the early churches of these
countries, and gave Holy Plays before the high
altars. Then they went to the castles and at last to
the theaters. It was only in Germany that great
musicians wrote music for them. In 1762, Haydn
wrote for them his toy symphony, “The Children’s
Fair,” which was followed by five operettas given in
the theater at Eisenstadt. Probably the great <cite>Passion
Play</cite> at Oberammergau has grown out of the
early puppet plays that were given in the monasteries
and cathedrals.</p>

<p class='c014'>The city of Munich built a little theater for Papa
Schmidt, an old man who had spent all his life giving
puppet plays. This was done through citizens
who felt indebted to him for the pleasure he had
given them as children. They said, the least they
could do was to build him a theater, a place for himself
and his daughter and their thousand puppets,
that included all the characters in the beautiful fairy
tales.</p>

<p class='c014'>In Vienna, the artist Richard Teschner has created
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>some remarkable modern marionettes. He has carved
them most delicately from wood and has shown
great ingenuity in the way he has put his little
figures together.</p>

<p class='c014'>In Bohemia, the puppets were interested in politics,
if they were serious, and in comedies if they
were not serious. In Hungary, they traveled with the
gypsies. In Poland and Russia, they are loved by all
the common people, and at Christmas celebrations
still appear in their ancient rôles as Joseph and Mary
and the Christ Child, as wise men, shepherds, and
angels.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>AMERICA</h4>

<p class='c016'>Puppets are not new in America. The North
American Indians for hundreds of years used them in
their great ceremonies. The Hopi Indians used marionettes
to represent the mystic maidens who in ancient
times gave them, according to their legends, the corn
and other seeds. This ceremony is performed in a
darkened room—in the center of which is a wooden
framework. The marionettes are placed on a stage or
platform and when the corn maiden’s song begins,
the figures bend their bodies forward and backward in
time to the music as they grind the meal between the
miniature grindstones before them. The little figures
are so cleverly manipulated that they even rub their
faces with meal as the young Indian girls are accustomed
to do. During the ceremony, two symbolic
marionette birds are made to walk back and forth,
on the framework, above the maidens, seeming to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>utter bird calls. The Hopi Indians also made marionettes
of their enemies, the serpents, which represented
floods and misfortune.</p>

<p class='c014'>Most of the marionettes that we have known in
America, until a few years ago, were Italian. They
were very shy and would not leave their Italian neighborhoods.
They often spoke no English. They gave
plays about heroes that we know little or nothing
about.</p>

<p class='c014'>In America, there is a growing list of friends of the
marionette. Probably the name best known to you
will be that of Tony Sarg, a charming artist who has
taken his puppet plays to the largest cities in our
country and delighted us with his <cite>Rip Van Winkle</cite>,
<cite>Rose and the King</cite>, and <cite>Don Quixote</cite>. The manager
of his marionettes, Mr. Matthew Searle, is also
an artist of ingenuity and taste.</p>

<p class='c014'>In Chicago, the splendid work of Mr. and Mrs.
Maurice Brown made new friends for the marionette.
Mr. Perry Dilley introduced marionettes and guignol
to the people of California. He produced a great
number of interesting plays and all of his puppets
are exceptionally fine. Mr. William Duncan and Mr.
Edward Mabley, creators of the “Tatterman Marionettes,”
have brought to the marionette stage unusual
imagination and skill, which is admirably shown in
their <cite>The Melon Thief</cite>, <cite>The King of the Golden River</cite>,
and <cite>Pierre Patelin</cite>.</p>

<p class='c014'>Madge Anderson has written beautifully of her puppet
heroes. Mrs. Helen Haiman Joseph has written an
excellent <cite>Book of Marionettes</cite>. If it were possible one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>would like to add the complete list of all those who
are carrying on the great tradition of the marionette.
The interest, already created, leads one to hope that
America may take her place high up in the marionette
tree.</p>

<h3 class='c002'><span class='c012'>CHAPTER II</span><br> The Marionette—Its Famous Friends</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>Every person is proud of his famous friends. If
we know a great artist, engineer, or traveler, we think
we are fortunate. Can you imagine having so many
famous friends that you could not count them? This
has been the good fortune of marionettes. The names
of all their Egyptian friends seem to be lost. But
it is not so with their Grecian friends. Archimedes,
Socrates, and Plato are the names of three famous
friends that have come down to us. Archimedes, the
greatest inventor of his time, liked puppets, it is said,
because he could devise so many clever ways of making
them move and appear human. Socrates probably
cared nothing for the mechanism. He enjoyed taking
a puppet in his own hands, asking it clever questions,
and then furnishing the equally clever answers. These
most unusual conversations would soon gather about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>him a crowd of Athenian men and women, who were
greatly interested in his humor, irony, and whimsical
paradoxes. The dialogues would probably go on and
on until his scolding wife, Xantippe, appeared. Plato
also cared little for their mechanism, but like his great
master, Socrates, was interested only when they were
made to talk about the very serious things of life, or
when he saw them representing the gods and heroes
in the beautiful scenes of the plays given on the small
stages built for them in one part of the great theaters.</p>

<p class='c014'>Kings and queens were among the famous Roman
friends of puppets. You may remember that puppets
were found in the tomb of the Empress Marie and
that the Emperor Antiochus cared so much for them
that he neglected the affairs of his great empire. He
had clever puppet makers as part of his royal household,
and delighted in planning the plays they were to
give. He designed the stage settings, and he sometimes
assisted the royal puppeteers.</p>

<p class='c014'>In India, China, and Japan, the great rulers were
greatly interested in puppets, and required their
presence at court.</p>

<p class='c014'>One of the most interesting stories of a royal friend
of the marionettes is that of the Emperor Charles V
of Spain. This strange ruler’s reason was clouded.
His devoted minister tried in many ways to divert
his beloved king, and finally succeeded when he
found that the king could be interested in puppets.
Puppet soldiers, puppet generals, puppet kings caught
his imagination. The cleverest hands of Spain made
them, by the hundred, for His Majesty, who handled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>them with such interest and pleasure that his reason
was finally restored. Two other great kings could be
added to the list of royal friends—they are Saladin
and Louis XIV of France.</p>

<p class='c014'>There is a long list of famous literary friends. Greatest
of these is Shakespeare, who not only enjoyed
marionettes, but wrote plays for them. Many people
are surprised when they learn that <cite>Midsummer
Night’s Dream</cite> and <cite>Julius Cæsar</cite> were written
for marionettes. Shakespeare’s friend, Ben Jonson,
wrote a marionette play, <cite>Every Man in His Humor</cite>.
Another great literary friend was Cervantes.
Some day you may wish to take his story of Don
Quixote and turn some of its wonderful scenes into a
play for marionettes. If you do so, you may be sure
that their immortal author would approve of your
venture.</p>

<p class='c014'>In France, among their many friends, was the great
dramatist Voltaire. At first he disliked marionettes
thoroughly. For it happened that they had made fun
of him, and, naturally, that was more than this great
wit could stand. Finally, the story goes, he was invited
to visit a friend who had a little marionette
theater and some puppets. When Voltaire took the
strings in his own hands, his feeling for them changed.
He found they could be made to say witty things, and
to make fun of one’s enemies. It ended by his writing
short plays for them to act.</p>

<p class='c014'>George Sand, the famous French novelist, made a
very simple but delightful puppet theater for her
little boy, Maurice, and set the fashion for puppets
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>among her literary friends. Stories could be told of
many other famous French friends, of Molière, Fontaine,
Doré, and Rousseau. Great French writers
still love marionettes. You probably know two of
these: Maurice Maeterlinck and Anatole France.</p>

<p class='c014'>When we go to Italy, we find other friends, but
none greater than Michael Angelo. Picture this artist
modeling heads for marionettes. We wonder what
they looked like and what became of them. His great
patron, Lorenzo de Medici, had a puppet theater
built for his palace in Florence.</p>

<p class='c014'>Marionettes have had famous musicians as their
friends. If you are interested in music, you will enjoy
reading about Joseph Haydn and the five toy symphonies
that he wrote for marionettes.</p>

<p class='c014'>Goldoni, the greatest Italian writer of comedies,
was born in Venice, that city in which, you remember,
puppets were first called marionettes. He lived near
the street where most of the puppet makers lived
and had their shops. As a child he played puppet
games with many other children in a little park near
his home. When he was seven years old he wrote a
puppet play and invited his friends to come to see and
hear it. He enjoyed writing plays that made them
laugh. When Goldoni grew up he was still the friend
of puppets because he felt that they had helped him in
learning the art of play writing.</p>

<p class='c014'>The German poet, Goethe, was a friend of puppets
from his childhood. When he was about the age of
seven, a friend of his good mother made some puppets
and sent them to him and his sister for a Christmas
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>present. The mother had a happy thought. She made
a little stage and set it in the doorway of a room, just
off the living room. On Christmas morning, after the
children had seen their presents, she had the family
sit down before the closed door. When she opened it,
there was a kind of porch concealed with a mysterious
curtain. The children were curious and eager to know
what was behind that half-transparent veil. The
mother, however, bade each sit down upon his stool. At
length, Goethe says, “All were silent, a whistle gave
the signal, the curtain rolled aloft and showed us the
interior of a temple painted in deep red colors. The
high priest, Samuel, appeared with Jonathan, and
their strange alternating voices seemed to me the
most striking thing on earth. Shortly after entered
Saul, overwhelmed with confusion at the impatience
of that heavy-limbed warrior who had defied him and
all his people. But how glad was I when the dapper
son of Jesse, with his crook and shepherd’s pouch and
sling, came hopping forth and said, ‘Dread king and
sovereign lord, let no one’s heart sink down because
of this. If your majesty will grant me leave, I will go
out to battle with this blustering giant!’</p>

<p class='c014'>“Here ended the first act, leaving the spectators
more curious than ever to see what further would
happen—each praying that the music might soon be
done. At last the curtain rose again. David devoted
the flesh of the monsters to the fowls of the air and
the beasts of the field; the Philistine scorned and bullied
him, stamped mightily with both his feet, and
at length fell like a mass of clay, affording a splendid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>termination to the piece, and then the virgins sang a
song: ‘Saul hath slain his thousands, but David his
ten thousands.’ The giant’s head was borne before his
little victor, who received the king’s beautiful daughter
to wife.” This is part of the description that Goethe
wrote when he grew up and became a famous man.</p>

<p class='c014'>Do read the delightful and vivid description which
Constantin Stanislavsky gives of his boyish experiences
with marionettes in his autobiography, <cite>My
Life in Art</cite>. “We had decided to exchange the living
actors for actors made of pasteboard and to begin the
construction of a marionette theater with scenery,
effects, and a full line of theatrical necessities. The
marionette theater demanded expenditures. We
needed a large table to put in the large doorway.
While above and beneath it, that is above and beneath
the marionette stage, the openings were covered
with sheets. In this manner, the public sat in one
room, the auditorium and the other room, which was
united to the first, was the stage and all its accessories.
It was there that we worked, we the artists, the
designers, the stage managers, and the inventors of
all sorts of scenic effects. My oldest brother also
joined us. He was an excellent draftsman, and a fine
inventor of stage effects. His help was important because
he had a little money, and we needed capital
for our work.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We began to paint scenery. At first we painted
on wrapping paper which tore and crumpled, but we
did not lose heart for we thought that with time, as
soon as we became rich (for we were to charge ten
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>kopeks as admission), we would buy pasteboard and
glue the painted wrapping paper to it. From the moment
that we began to feel ourselves managers and
directors of the new theater, that was being built according
to our plans, our lives became full. There was
something to think about every minute. There was
a great deal to do. In the drawer of the table there
always lay hidden some piece of theatrical work, the
figure of a marionette which was to be painted and
dressed, a piece of scenery, a bush, a tree, or the plan
and sketches for a new production. In the margins of
my books and copy books there were always sketches
of scenery or a geometric drawing. We always chose
moments of catastrophic character. For instance, an
act from <cite>The Corsair</cite>, which called for a sea quiet
in the daylight but stormy all night with a wrecked
ship, with heroes swimming for their lives, with the
appearance of a lighthouse, an escape from a watery
grave, the rising of the moon, prayer, and dawn.</p>

<p class='c014'>“These performances were always sold out, notwithstanding
the high price of admission. Many
people came to see them, some to encourage us, others
to amuse themselves. Our promenades between
lessons took on a very deep meaning. Before that we
went to the Kugnetsky Bridge to buy the photographs
of circus artists. But with the appearance of
our theater, there appeared a need for all sorts of
material for scenery and marionettes. Now we were
no longer too lazy to take a walk. We bought all sorts
of pictures, books with landscapes and costumes
which served as material for the scenery and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>dramatic personæ of our theater. These were the
first volume of a rapidly increasing library.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Perhaps that friend who has done most to keep the
world still interested in marionettes is Gordon Craig.
He is a great English artist who sees them not as so
much wood and cloth pulled about by a few strings
at the whim of careless people, but rather as real
creatures, human or more than human, quiet and
dignified, as the gods of old. It has been his delight
to give them again the great rôles of literature. He,
too, invited the greatest actors of Europe to come and
learn from them.</p>

<p class='c014'>Possibly you are asking what it is that gives such
friendships to the marionette. Perhaps none of its
great friends could answer. The marionette is quiet,
submissive, dignified, and mysterious. It becomes a
different thing in every hand. It expresses every
mood, thought, and fancy of the one who pulls the
strings. What will it do in your hands?</p>

<h3 class='c002'><span class='c012'>CHAPTER III</span><br> Choosing Your Play</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>It may not always be easy to find just the play you
wish for your marionettes. If you should go to your
library and ask for a marionette play, it is possible
that the librarian would have very little to offer you.
But if you should go to her and ask for a good story
that you could make into a marionette play, you
would probably be surprised to see how many books
she would place before you. You might even feel confused
when you came to make your choice. Suppose
that you wish to give a humorous play. Begin by
making a list of the very best of the humorous books:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><cite>Alice in Wonderland</cite>—Carroll</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>You will find that it is not at all difficult to turn the
vivid and amusing characters of these books into
marionettes. Neither is it difficult to turn these stories
into marionette plays.</p>

<p class='c014'>First: Make a list of the most important incidents
in the story.</p>

<p class='c014'>Second: Decide upon the number of scenes that
you think necessary for your play.</p>

<p class='c014'>Third: Decide upon the number of characters required
for these scenes.</p>

<p class='c014'>These three things you must do if your play is to be
only the simplest kind of a Burattini play, if it is to
be a shadow play, or a marionette play.</p>

<p class='c014'>If you are not experienced in making marionette
plays, you may think that you need a great many
characters to act your story. But the more you learn
about marionette plays, the more you will be surprised
to find how few characters, and incidents, and
scenes you will need. Choose only those which are
most important. This means that you should know
your story very well indeed before you begin to make
your play. When you thoroughly know your story
and all the characters in it, all that they say and do,
you will enjoy your play-making quite as much as
your play-giving.</p>

    <dt>Incident V.</dt>
    <dd>Alice and the Duchess, the Cheshire Cat, the Cook and the Pig Baby

    </dl>

<p class='c014'>Of course, a dozen plays could be made from these
two books, but these six incidents will be quite enough
for your purpose. A good play, as you know, must
not be too long, it must begin in the right way, the
story must hold together, and it must be very interesting
all the time, and it must have the right ending.
The above six incidents were selected with these requirements
in mind.</p>

<p class='c014'>Now, how many acts shall we have? Since this is a
dream story, the play might begin by showing Alice
falling asleep under the trees, and the White Rabbit
running past, and then Alice jumping up and following
him. This part of the play we might call a Prologue
since it begins the story. Then follow with:</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>Act I.</dt>
    <dd>Scene: In the woods
    </dd>
    <dt>Act II.</dt>
    <dd>Scene: In the Duchess’s kitchen
    </dd>
    <dt>Act III.</dt>
    <dd>Scene: The mad tea party
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>To bring the play to an end, there might be a closing
scene, or epilogue, showing Alice waking from her
dream and becoming herself again.</p>

<p class='c014'>We must now decide just how many characters are
really necessary in these six incidents. Let us take a
pencil and make the list as we find them in these
three acts:</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>Prologue:</dt>
    <dd>Alice and the White Rabbit.
    </dd>
    <dt>Act I.</dt>
    <dd>Alice, the Caterpillar, Tweedle Dee, Tweedle Dum, Humpty Dumpty
    </dd>
    <dt>Act II.</dt>
    <dd>Alice, the Duchess, the Pig Baby, the Cook, the Cheshire Cat
    </dd>
    <dt>Act III.</dt>
    <dd>Alice, the Hatter, the March Hare, the Dormouse
    </dd>
    <dt>Epilogue.</dt>
    <dd>Alice and the White Rabbit.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c014'>Here we have made from six important incidents,
in the two stories about Alice, a marionette play of
three acts, with a cast of thirteen characters. This
play might be called <cite>The Adventures of Alice</cite>.</p>

<p class='c014'>Possibly you and your friends are much interested

<p class='c014'>Let us take one of these, Howard Pyle’s <cite>Men of

<p class='c014'>When you have studied the story of <cite>Men of Iron</cite>

<p class='c014'>Marionette plays are exactly like all other plays.
They need songs and dances, and many things that
will be certain to interest the audience. Here is a list
of the incidents that were added to this play when it
was given by the boys and girls of Fairmount Junior
High School in Cleveland, Ohio:</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>1.</dt>
    <dd>An Italian bear trainer, who whistled a jolly tune while his bear danced and did his 
    tricks.
    </dd>
    <dt>2.</dt>
    <dd>The song of the Armorer as he worked at his forge. (The forge was so made and wired that 
    every stroke of the hammer on the anvil gave forth a shower of sparks.)
    </dd>
    <dt>3.</dt>
    <dd>A fight between Myles and the young squire, Walter Blunt.
    </dd>
    <dt>4.</dt>
    <dd>Practice at the pells to show the training of the squires of that day.
    </dd>
    <dt>5.</dt>
    <dd>Lady Alice’s little dance.
    </dd>
    <dt>6.</dt>
    <dd>Lady Anne’s song as she plays her lute.
    </dd>
    <dt>7.</dt>
    <dd>Alice’s tame pigeon that flew down to her shoulder.
    </dd>
    <dt>8.</dt>
    <dd>The wandering minstrel with his lute and his ballad of Chevy Chase.
    </dd>
    <dt>9.</dt>
    <dd>The antics, capers, and songs of the jester.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c014'>In order to prepare the audience for the play and
to carry every person back in imagination to the time
of this play, an announcer was chosen, who, in the
costume of that day, came before the curtain and
gave the introduction to the play. This announcer was
chosen with great care because his part was so important.
He was responsible for carrying his audience
back into the days of chivalry, not only by his speech
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>and costume, but by his tone of voice and his gestures.
Here is the prologue that one of the children wrote:</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>There were many things in this play that every
member of the class was uncertain about. No one
knew about the kinds of costumes that were worn in
England in the time of Henry IV. Neither did anyone
know about houses, gardens, and furniture, nor about
the armor and the musical instruments of that day
until he had studied reference books. Here is a list of
some of the books that were found helpful:</p>

<p class='c014'>The Museum of Art and the Historical Museum
can be visited for first-hand information. Librarians,
history, art, and English teachers can be counted
upon for help. The librarian will help you to find
the kind of book you wish, and will be glad to help
find reference books and pictures. The history teacher
will help you in learning about the life and customs
of the people who are of the time of your play. The
English teacher can be of invaluable help to you in
working out the development of your play. Last, but
not least, you will have very great need of your art
and manual training teachers. They will help you in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>learning how to make your marionettes, how to make
your marionette stage, how to make your scenery and
properties, how to light the stage, what colors to use
in your costumes and in your scenery, and how to
place both your scenery and your actors on the stage.
They will also assist you in planning the stage pictures.</p>

<p class='c014'>Since every act of a play should help in telling the
story, in solving the principal problem, and in bringing
about the proper ending, this arrangement might
be made:</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>Act I.</dt>
    <dd>David reads and talks to Pegotty about her brother’s boathouse. Pegotty invites David to 
    spend a week there.

    Master Dick.

    </dl>

<p class='c014'>At the same time that Charles Dickens was writing
<cite>David Copperfield</cite> and other stories about the people
he knew, several clever artists were making drawings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>of the same people. You probably know many of the
amusing pictures they drew, especially those of
Cruikshank, Tenniel, and Du Maurier. If you wish
to know how David and Pegotty and Betsy Trotwood
and little Emily really looked, ask your librarian to
show you some of the illustrations that these artists
made. Because these pictures give the very best idea
of how the people of Dickens’ time looked, you might
copy them for your marionettes. Their faces have a
great deal of character, their clothes are those of
that time, and they are so quaint and characteristic
that they will never be uninteresting.</p>

<p class='c014'>Probably the most beautiful marionette plays that
one can imagine could be done from the great stories
in the Bible. Just as in the early days of Christianity,
when marionettes helped the people to see and feel
the great scenes in their new religion, so, it would
seem, that a time might come again when the little
figures might return to their earliest uses. This could
well be done in Christmas and Easter plays for the
church and Sunday school. Imagine the story of

<p class='c014'>How many beautiful plays appropriate for Christmas,
Easter, and saints’ days could be made from the
lives of the saints! If you are interested in a play for
your Sunday school or your parochial school, read
and make into a play the life of Saint Christopher,
Saint George, Saint Patrick, Saint Francis of Assisi,
Saint Agnes, Saint Genevieve, Saint Catherine of
Sienna, or Saint Joan of Arc.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>A chair, sofa, or table top may have been the
first stage on which you moved about your tin soldiers
and paper dolls. Your imagination supplied the
scenery and lighting. A small table turned upside
down and placed on top of another table may have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>been your next invention. A curtain drawn about its
three sides and your string of Christmas-tree lights
gave you a very satisfactory little theater. As your
stagecraft developed, you may have seen possibilities
in a soap box or a dry goods box. By knocking out
one side to make a proscenium opening and painting
scenery on the back of the box or on to cardboards
which you slipped in and out, you had a very real
stage. With a proscenium arch made from cardboard
and decorated to suit the play, a little curtain on a
rod, Christmas-tree lights, and your company of
small doll actors, you had a complete theater. It
could be placed in a door or an archway, or between
two screens.</p>

<h3 class='c002'><span class='c012'>CHAPTER V</span><br> Making Your Marionette</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>In your adventures with marionettes, probably
nothing will give you more pleasure than the actual
making of them. This is equally true of the Burattini,
of the doll puppet, and of the real marionette.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Burattini, Guignol, or Mitten puppet is the
simplest kind of marionette. It is usually nothing
more than a head, two arms, and an empty sack.
The most important part of a Guignol is its head.
This can be made from unbleached muslin, from a
hollow doll’s head, it can be carved out of a block of
soft wood, or it can be made from papier-mâché.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Muslin Head.</i> Here is a pattern for the unbleached
muslin head. Sew the two halves together and then
stuff firmly with cotton. If you dampen the cheeks,
the muslin will stretch and then you can round
them out with more cotton. Into the neck insert a
cuff of stiff paper, ⅞ of an inch in diameter. It should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>be fastened either by sewing or glueing. This cuff
gives you space for the finger which manipulates the
head. Water colors or crayons may be used for painting
the face. Before you begin, experiment on scraps
of muslin.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_p053.jpg' alt='[Head]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c014'><i>Doll’s Head.</i> If you wish to use the hollow head of a
doll, you will probably find it necessary to remodel
its features. This is done by taking papier-mâché, a
mixture of bits of paper mixed with flour paste, and
building out the nose, the cheeks, and the chin, in
order to give them more character. The building
out must be done gradually, a bit at a time, after you
have made the surface rough by the use of sandpaper
or a file. When you are sure that you have finished
the head, stand twenty or thirty feet away from it
and see if it is still interesting to you. This is an excellent
test. Those in the last rows of your audience will
be even farther away and your Burattini must hold
their interest.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Wooden Head.</i> Boys who like to whittle will enjoy
carving out wooden heads. If you decide to carve the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>head from wood, use a soft wood, such as pine. Start
with a piece about 5 inches long by 3½ inches wide by
3½ inches high. It is well to keep in mind that the
head is egg shaped. The chin is the small end of the
egg. Observe that the eyes are placed halfway between
the top of the head and the chin, and that the nose
is placed halfway between the eyes and the chin.
Notice, also, that the mouth is placed halfway between
the nose and the chin. The illustration will
show you how to go about the carving. Cut the big
planes first, then the smaller planes. Curve the cheeks
and chin if the character requires it. You will then be
ready to drill the ⅞ inch hole up into the neck. Into
this hole is thrust the forefinger of the puppeteer.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_p054.jpg' alt='[Head]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c014'><i>Papier-mâché Head.</i> If you wish to make a papier-mâché
head for your Burattini, follow the directions
for making the head of the true marionette which you
will find on page 67.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Hair.</i> For hair, use yarn, lamb’s wool, or frayed
hemp, as is best suited to the character. The toe of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>stocking makes an excellent foundation for the wig,
since it so perfectly fits the head. When the material
for the hair has been sewed to this foundation, glue
it to the head. When the glue has set, you can arrange
the hair.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_p055.jpg' alt='[Hands]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c014'><i>Hands.</i> Burattini hands should be cut out of wood
and shaped as in the illustration. Sandpapering makes
them smooth. Little cuffs of cardboard should be
glued or tacked onto the wrists in order to make a
place for the thumb and second finger of the puppeteer.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Painting.</i> When you have finished carving both
the head and hands you are ready to paint them.
You will need red, yellow, blue, and white oil paints.
Use a piece of smooth wood or glass for a palette.
Squeeze onto your palette a small amount of each
color. As you know, people do not have pure-white
skins. There is a tinge of yellow-orange in the white
man’s skin, deep red and orange in that of the red
man, brown in that of the Negro, and yellow in that
of the Oriental. Begin by squeezing out onto your
palette a small quantity of white paint. Only clowns’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>faces, however, are painted a pure white. You must
add a bit of yellow and red to the white paint if you
are painting a white man’s face. If you are painting
a red man’s face, you must add more red and a bit of
blue. For the face of an Oriental, add yellow to your
white paint and the least bit of red and blue. For the
black man’s face, use black paint instead of white
paint and into it mix a very small amount of orange
and blue. Use a palette knife for mixing oil paints and
turpentine for thinning them. Do not be timid when
you begin to paint. Strong and vigorous painting is
as important and necessary as strong and vigorous
modeling in bringing out the features and expression.
When the painting is finished, the face should fully
express your idea of the character.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_p056.jpg' alt='[Body]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c014'><i>The Body.</i> Now we come to the mantle or cloak
which gives a kind of body to the Burattini. The
illustration shows patterns for the front, back, and
sleeves. To this foundation you can sew any costume
that your character may require. The hands are
fastened into the ends of the sleeves. When the cloak
is fastened securely about the neck, it becomes a kind
of sack, open only at the bottom. Now slip your hand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>inside this sack or mantle, your forefinger into the
head, your thumb and second finger into the arms.
The head will bow, the arms will move, and the little
figure comes to life.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ANIMAL BURATTINI</h4>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_p057.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic005'>
<p><i>A After completing papier-mâché head, cut out lower jaw as shown by dotted line. Then replace and paste a piece of thin muslin over lower cut, as shown by light line. This will not be seen when the head is painted.</i><br>  <br>  <i>B Dotted lines show the narrow elastic glued to upper and lower jaw. One piece on each side. The forefinger of the puppeteer pulls down the lower jaw, when it is released the elastic snaps the mouth shut.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Burattini animals can be made for such stories as
<cite>The Three Pigs</cite>, <cite>The Three Bears</cite>, and <cite>Little Red Riding
Hood</cite>. There are several ways of making them. The
first way is to use the head of an old toy animal. Into
the center of this head cut a hole for the forefinger.
Then attach this head to a suitable sack or coat.
The forepaws of the animal can be fastened into the
sleeves.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>Another way is to carve the heads and paws out of
soft wood. A third way is to cut them out of suitable
cloth. A fourth way is to make them out of papier-mâché
in the same way as the papier-mâché heads
described on page <a href='#Page_67'>67</a>. This illustration will show you
how the lower jaw is cut out and then attached in such
a way that the puppeteer can open and close the
mouth.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Scale.</i> Before you begin to make your marionette,
you must decide upon the kind of stage you intend to
use, for the size of the stage determines the size of the
marionette. It is the right relation of the marionette
to the stage that creates an illusion and makes your
audience feel that the little figures are life-size. For
the semi-professional stage, use a scale of 2½ inches or
3 inches to the foot. If you use a scale of 2½ inches to
a foot, it would make a 15-inch marionette represent
a 6-foot man. If you use a scale of 3 inches to a foot,
your 6-foot hero would be represented by a marionette
18 inches high. Never forget your scale of measurements.
All properties and stage settings must be
worked out to the same scale you have fixed for your
marionettes.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>TURNING DOLLS INTO MARIONETTES</h4>

<p class='c016'>A very simple kind of marionette can be made from
a ten- or fifteen-cent doll. Change the face as you did
the Burattini face. Then take off the arms and legs
and separate the arms at the elbows and the legs at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>the knees. Fasten the upper and lower arms together
with tape. Do the same thing with the upper and
lower legs. Then fasten the arms and legs to the body
as in the illustration. The tape gives free movement
at the joints.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_p059.jpg' alt='[Marionette]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c014'><i>Strings.</i> This type of marionette requires not more
than seven strings: two for the shoulders, two for the
hands, two for the knees, and one for the back. The
shoulder string should be about 42 inches long. The
other strings are longer as you can see in the illustration.
Waxed black linen thread can be used for the
strings.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Controllers.</i> For this kind of marionette you can use
either a horizontal-bar controller or a cross-bar controller.
The illustration gives measurements and construction,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>and indicates the place for attaching the
strings.</p>

<p class='c014'>STOCKING MARIONETTE</p>

<p class='c014'>Another kind of marionette is made from old
stockings or any soft material. The head and body
are in one piece. Each arm is in one piece. Each leg
is in two pieces. Cut and sew according to directions.
Stuff the head very firmly with cotton. At the base
of the neck leave a quarter of an inch between the
two rows of stitching. This will permit the head to
move. The body should be stuffed less firmly than
the head, especially at the waistline, so that the figure
can bend easily.</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>

<p class='c019'><i>Note: Pieces of lead or small shot are used to weight the feet and
hands. A lead dress weight may be sewed in the torso to give the body
weight. Cotton or soft rags are used for the stuffing.</i></p>

<p class='c020'><i>Staples.</i> Into each side of the head, where the ears
would naturally come, insert a staple. It requires a
great deal of patience to insert these staples into this
kind of head but it can be done. Just where you place
these staples is very important. If you place them too
far forward the head will be drawn too far back when
the strings are attached to the staples. On the contrary,
if the staples are inserted too far back, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>head will fall forward when suspended from the
strings. If you wish to make a pompous, strutting
character, then place the staples forward. If you wish
to show a hunchback or bowed old age, then place the
staples quite far back. Between these two extremes is
the normal place for your staples.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Modeling.</i> When the staples have been inserted,
dip your fingers into water and dampen the head and
then cover it with some kind of modeling clay that
hardens when exposed to the air. The features of your
character can be modeled with your fingers and the
help of an orange stick or a toothpick. Do not cover
the staples, for the head-strings must be attached to
them later. This kind of marionette head should be
painted with tempera colors or with oil paints. Paint
the hands the same color as the face. When the paint
is dry, cover the head with glue and attach the hair,
which may be made from yarn, mercerized cotton,
silk, or lamb’s wool.</p>

<p class='c014'>A marionette of this kind could be used on the semi-professional
stage if it is carefully constructed, made
to scale, and appropriately costumed. The strings are
attached to the head staples, to the shoulders, the
hands, the back, and to the knees. For this type of
marionette use the cross-bar controller.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>THE REAL MARIONETTE</h4>

<p class='c016'>The third type of marionette, which might be
called the real marionette, is somewhat more complicated,
but it is better suited to the larger stage and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>to more exacting plays. There is scarcely a thing that
this type of marionette cannot be made to do if skilfully
constructed. Its greater flexibility of neck, waist,
wrist, and ankle makes it possible for it to bow, kneel,
sit down, turn its head, dance, play a musical instrument,
climb a wall, or perform any number of lively
tricks.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CHARACTER</h4>

<p class='c016'>A marionette should be as individual as a human
being, both in its appearance and in its character. Before
you make your marionette, you must have clearly
in mind the character you wish to portray. You should
aim to make its appearance indicate its character.
Let us suppose that you are about to make a marionette
of Myles in <cite>Men of Iron</cite>. Let us make a list of his
characteristics: brave, strong, loyal, daring, courageous.
Now choose one of these traits which you think
most fully sums up the character of Myles. Probably
you will choose the word “courageous.” The problem
now is to create a marionette whose appearance will
suggest the Myles who is brave, strong, loyal, daring,
but, above all things, courageous. Can you not see
him, tall, broad of shoulder, fearless of eye, as he
stands before Sir James Lee? Strong of limb and
strong of will, he reflects the spirit of his time. You
now have the problem of creating out of a few bits
of wood and cloth this daring, headstrong young
squire.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>
<img src='images/i_p064.jpg' alt='[Drawing]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Begin by making a working drawing somewhat
like the illustration. Now make drawings of the face
of Myles just as you imagine it, front view and side
view. Always consider the age of the character you
wish to model. Faces of the young are smooth and
round, the brow unwrinkled; those of the middle
aged less smooth and round, with the jaw, chin, and
nose more clearly defined. In old age, sagging muscles
produce lines and hollows around the eyes, nose, and
mouth. You must also consider the structure of a
face. This means giving attention to the shape of the
jaw, chin, nose, lips, and the eye sockets. In modeling
the face of Myles in <cite>Men of Iron</cite>, you would naturally
give him a forceful chin and nose, and a large, firm
mouth. If you were modeling Lady Alice in the same
play, you would express her daintiness and lightness
by giving her a delicate nose, smiling lips, rounded
cheeks and chin. Lastly, you should study the expression
of the face. Have you ever noticed what
happens to the muscles around the mouth when a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>person smiles or is sad or angry? When we smile the
muscles lift the corners of the mouth upward; when
we are sad the mouth droops at the corners; when we
are angry our lips become straight and firmly set.
The brow is very tell-tale and can show different
moods. In surprise, the brows are arched. Curiosity
draws the brows together, anger draws them together
and downward. Sadness is shown by the drooping of
both brows and mouth.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_p065.jpg' alt='[Heads]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c014'>If you are to become a successful puppet maker,
keep a small sketch book in your pocket and make
numerous sketches of many different types of faces
and of human figures.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Modeling.</i> With your drawings before you, take a
lump of clay or plasticine and model it into the general
egg shape of the head. The small end will represent
the chin. The large end will represent the crown
of the head. Add the clay for the neck. Draw a light
line on the clay to locate the brow, the length of the
nose, and the position of the mouth. Now while you
hold this egg-shaped head in your hands, place your
thumbs just below the line of the brow, and gently
and firmly press the clay down and out and up to
form the eye sockets. Then build up the nose and lips.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>It is unnecessary to model the ears. In the first stages
of your modeling, you cannot expect the head to
resemble your ideal character, because you will be
striving for the general proportions of the face. When
once you have attained these proportions you can
then begin to work for a likeness. Besides your ten
fingers, you may find an orange stick or a sharpened
match a valuable tool.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Making a Mold.</i> After you have finished the head
it is necessary to make a plaster of Paris mold of it.
One way to do this is to take a small cardboard box
that will hold the head and allow an inch of space on
all six sides. Grease the box on the inside with vaseline.
At the same time grease thoroughly and evenly with
a brush the clay or plasticine head. Now mix about
one half pint of plaster of Paris with enough water
to give it the consistency of thick cream. This must
be done with quickness, for the hardening process
cannot be stopped once it has set in. Pour this mixture
into the greased box until it is half full. Then
place the head, back down, into the plaster. Allow
fifteen to thirty minutes for the plaster of Paris to
harden. Now grease the exposed surface of the clay or
plasticine head. Mix more plaster with water and
cover the face thoroughly. Allow this to stand overnight.
The next day, when you remove the box, the
two halves of the plaster cast can be separated. Out
will fall the clay or plasticine head, which you will
no longer need because you now have the two molds
for making the papier-mâché head.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>A simpler way to make the mold is this: Mark the
clay as in the illustration. Then insert pieces of tin or
stiff paper, such as oak tag. When the clay is dry,
apply a coat of vaseline to it and to the tin or paper.
Then apply the plaster of Paris and keep applying it
until you think it is fully an inch thick. After the plaster
hardens, proceed in the same manner with the other
side of the head. When both sides are hard, separate
them from the clay and you will have two molds.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_p067.jpg' alt='[Heads]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c014'><i>Papier-mâché.</i> You are now ready to make the
papier-mâché heads. Begin by making a small quantity
of flour paste. Take two heaping tablespoonfuls
of flour and mix with cold water to the consistency of
cream, add two cups of hot water, place over fire and
stir constantly until it comes to the boiling point and
boil for two minutes. A few drops of oil of cloves will
keep the paste fresh in hot weather.</p>

<p class='c014'>Now tear wrapping paper into small strips about
five inches long. Soak them in water for a few minutes,
then wring out and dip into the flour paste.
Take a piece and rub it gently between the fingers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>until the paper feels like wet chamois skin. Then
press it into the back of the mold for the head. Continue
to cover the surface with piece after piece. If
necessary, you may tear the paper into smaller pieces.
There must not be a wrinkle, but the pieces should
overlap slightly. In this way you cover the entire
surface with paper of one color. For the second layer
use paper of another color. For the third layer use the
first color, and so on, alternately, through the fifth
layer. This alternation of colors will help you to keep
account of the layers, and insures uniform thickness.
Allow the edges of the paper to extend over the edges
of the mold.</p>

<p class='c014'>Do the same thing with the mold for the face, but
use much more care to see that every depression is
smoothly and evenly filled in order to bring out the
features properly. The paper should stay in the mold
until dry. The two halves of the head and neck can
then easily be removed. The edges should be trimmed
off. The two halves can be held together and fastened
with strips of papier-mâché.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_p068.jpg' alt='[Heads]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c014'>When you have finished making the head, cut out
the crown as you see in the illustration. A round stick
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>is now pushed down into the neck with its lower end
extending through the neck as you can see. This stick
should fit very closely. If it does not fit closely, a few
tacks will keep it from slipping. Now, take glue and
rags, and fill them into the small spaces between this
stick and the upper part of the neck. Do not spare the
glue. The crown can now be fitted back onto the
head and fastened with a few strips of papier-mâché.
The following day, when the glue is thoroughly set,
you can insert a screw eye into the base of the neck.
The head is then complete.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>It is possible to make marionettes which can open
their mouths. This is done by cutting out the lower
lip and chin in one piece and then fastening it to a
rounded piece of wood, and inserting it through the
crown of the head. The illustration is a working
drawing of the Duchess in the <cite>Adventures of Alice</cite>
and shows the way the piece was weighted and then
fastened inside the head. This same principle can be
used in various ways in constructing the heads of
marionette animals.</p>

<p class='c014'>The body consists of the trunk, arms, and legs. For
the trunk, you will need two pieces of wood shaped
as you see in the illustration. Here is a table for approximate
measurements for the shoulder and hip
pieces for the 15- and 18-inch marionette:</p>

<p class='c021'>18-inch marionette man—shoulders 4 inches wide,
hips 3 inches wide</p>

<p class='c021'>16-inch marionette woman—shoulders 3 inches wide,

<p class='c021'>15-inch marionette man—shoulders 3 inches wide,
hips 2½ inches wide</p>

<p class='c021'>13½-inch marionette woman—shoulders 2½ inches
wide, hips 2½ inches wide</p>

<p class='c014'>Keep your character in mind. A warrior will have
broad, heavy shoulders and be deep of chest. A slender
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>young woman will have a light frame. Take the shoulders
and hip piece, and place them on your working
drawing as in the illustration and then fasten them
together with a strip of cloth, tacked as indicated.</p>

    </dl>

<p class='c014'><i>Hands.</i> Arms, hands, legs, and feet are yet to be
constructed. Let us begin with the hand. Its length
is that of the face from the chin to the line of the hair.
Into a piece of wood drive seven brads as in the illustration.
Take a piece of light-weight copper wire,
such as a strand of aërial wire, about thirty inches
long, and attach one end to the lower wrist brad.
You then loop the wire around the brads loosely, in
the order indicated, beginning and ending with “A.”
When you return to “A,” lift the wire loops from the
brads carefully, holding the wrist loop. Now thread
the loose end of the wire through these wrist loops
in order to fasten them together. With the loose
end, you now begin the tying of the two wires of
the thumb together by going under and over as the
illustration indicates. From the thumb, go to the
fingers, taking each in turn. After tying the little
finger, return to the wrist and wrap it three or four
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>times before cutting off the last bit of wire. This wire
frame corresponds to the bony structure of the hand.
Small pieces of plasticine or modeling wax are now
applied, long narrow strips to the fingers, heavier
strips for the palm of the hand. A hand should show
character. Keep this in mind as you are shaping it.
The last thing to be done is the wrapping of the hand
with quarter-inch white tape. Begin at the wrist,
then wrap the thumb, carry the tape back to the
wrist, then wrap the palm of the hand. When the
hand has been carefully wrapped, then take a needle
and thread and close any openings, such as those at
the ends of the fingers or in the palms of the hands.
The hand can now be pressed into any number of lifelike
positions.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Arms.</i> The upper and lower arm are made in one piece
from white stockings or any other soft white material.
The illustration indicates fairly wide seams. Begin your
sewing at the wrist and follow the arrow around and
back to the wrist. Now stuff the upper arm rather
lightly with cotton. When you reach the elbow, stop
and sew twice across, leaving one-fourth inch between
the rows. This will make the arm flexible at the elbow.
Then stuff the lower arm until it is quite firm. Into
the open wrist insert and sew the hand. Attach a
small piece of tape to the top of the upper arm and
then tack it to the shoulder piece as in the illustration.</p>

    </dl>

<p class='c014'><i>Legs and Feet.</i> The leg consists of an upper and lower
part and a foot. These three parts may be made of
cloth or of wood. If made of cloth, cut and sew and
stuff according to the illustration. For a dancer a
long silk stocking should be drawn over the entire
leg to conceal the mechanics of the knee. This was
done with the marionette dancers in the ballet <cite>Petrouchka</cite>.
It is sometimes necessary to have a barefoot
character, as in the play of <cite>Tom Sawyer</cite>. In
that case the foot is made in much the same way as
the wire and tape hand was made, as you can see in
the illustration. If you prefer to carve the leg and
foot out of wood, there are several ways of doing this.
A very simple way is shown in the illustration. When
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>forming the upper and lower leg, keep in mind the
fact that the marionette’s lower leg works just like
your own, which goes backward but never forward or
sidewise. The attaching of the cloth legs to the hip
piece requires thought and judgment. Two tacks
should be used to fasten each leg securely. If these
tacks are well placed, the legs will hang evenly and
the feet will point forward.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_p074.jpg' alt='[Head]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c014'><i>Attaching the Head.</i> When the arms and legs are
attached to the body, take the head and place the
screw eye in the hole that is in the center of the
shoulder piece. A brad driven through from front
to back will secure the head and allow free movement
in any direction.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Painting.</i> For this type of marionette you will have
better results if you paint the face and hands with oil
paints, rather than with water colors or tempera.
Remember that there is a tinge of yellow-orange in
the white man’s skin, deep red and orange in the red
man’s skin, brown in that of the Negro, and yellow in
that of the Oriental.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>You might think that you were now ready to costume
your marionette. Not so. The reason for this
is that if you costumed your marionette without consulting
the group, you might find that your marionette
would not fit into the stage picture at all. Therefore
the next step is group discussion of the background,
and of the colors of the costumes seen on the
stage together.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Backgrounds.</i> A background may be either light,
medium, or dark. If the background is light, the costumes
which appear against it should be somewhat
darker. Likewise if the background is dark, the costumes
which appear against it should be lighter. You
might think that a costume could be seen quite easily
if it were of a color unlike the background. This is
not true, if the costume and background are of the
same color value. If you experiment and observe your
stage picture from a distance, you will discover that
you must use light-colored costumes against a dark-colored
background, or dark-colored costumes against
a light-colored background. This contrast between
light and dark need not be a strong one. However,
there must be some contrast if the figures are to be
seen from a distance. Stage compositions build themselves
about the most important characters of the
play. Therefore, the costumes of these important
characters must be outstanding. They must be in
contrast to the background and to the other costumes.
The costumes of the less important characters
should not rival those of the principal characters.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>With these suggestions in mind, you are ready to begin
the costuming of your marionette.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Costuming.</i> In the family scrap bag you will probably
find all the materials you need: cotton, wool,
silk, satin, velvet, ribbons, laces, and braids. Your
marionette may represent a character of a particular
period and country. If so, it must have a costume
similar to the costume worn in that country at that
time. In your library, you can probably find books of
historic costumes from which you can make sketches
or tracings. It is well to sketch several of the costumes
that seem best suited to your character. In this way,
you acquire, not only a knowledge of the costumes,
but of details such as headdresses, shoes, and ornaments.
Also make careful color notes. On the tree of
the marionette, you will find a gay company of little
figures in historic costumes of many lands. They are
worth studying.</p>

<p class='c014'>Suppose your character is an imaginary one, such
as an elf, fairy, or gnome. Then turn to the books
illustrated by such artists as Dulac, Rackham, Nielson,
and Bilibin. They will inspire you to create and
costume your own elves, fairies, and gnomes. Remember
to choose suitable materials and appropriate
colors. For example, thin, gauzy materials would be
appropriate for fairies, while coarse, dark materials
would be appropriate for gnomes. Try to express
your conception of a character in the colors you
choose for its costume.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>With your sketches and materials before you, cut
out the costume in the same way that you would cut
out doll clothes. It might be wise to experiment with
paper patterns before you cut into your materials.
Avoid wide seams, as they make a garment clumsy.
Both your mother and your sewing teacher can give
you valuable suggestions for both cutting and making.
When your marionette is costumed, drive a staple
into each shoulder for the shoulder strings. It is a fine
art to costume a marionette. It requires not only research
and thought but it also requires skill, taste, and
subtle character appreciations.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Controller.</i> Here is a sketch of a controller suitable
for the true marionette. The frame is made from
wood, the loop is of leather. Follow the measurements
and directions as indicated.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Strings.</i> Black and white woven fish line makes the
very best strings for your marionettes. It is strong, it
does not tangle, and it is almost invisible. Unfortunately
it is expensive. A fifty-cent spool will string but
two marionettes. Strong gray linen thread may be
used instead. If you cannot get gray linen thread,
then use white linen thread and gray it by rubbing
with a cloth that has been dipped in black paint or in
India ink. If you use black thread, gray it by rubbing
with white chalk. Strings should be made as nearly
invisible as possible. If the linen thread is rubbed
with a little beeswax, it is less liable to break and to
become tangled.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span><i>Cutting the Strings.</i> It is an exciting moment when
you begin to cut the strings, for the strings bring
the puppet to life. The first to be cut are the head
strings. They should be at least forty-two inches long
and should be tied securely to the head staples. Next,
measure and cut the hand strings. These will be
longer, since they are measured from the palm of the
hand as it hangs down. Allow three extra inches for
arm movements. The back string is measured from
the small of the back. The knee strings are measured
from the knees. The shoulder string is not cut at this
time.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Attaching the Strings.</i> The head strings are the first
to be attached to the controller. Next in order, attach
the back string. Now you are ready to measure and
attach the shoulder string. It goes from one shoulder
up through the screw eyes in the swinging bar, and
then down again to the other shoulder. When the knee
strings have been attached to the separate horizontal
bars, your marionette is complete.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ANIMAL MARIONETTES</h4>

<p class='c016'>It is possible to make a surprising number of different
kinds of animal marionettes. There are many
plays in which they are indispensable. For instance, in
<cite>Men of Iron</cite>, the horses are indispensable, as there
could be no tournament scene without them. The
bear and the doves are not indispensable but they
add a touch of humor and lively interest. When we
gave the play the making of these animals presented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>an interesting problem. Two boys asked to be responsible
for the horses in <cite>Men of Iron</cite>. They went
downtown and looked about in the toy departments
of the largest stores until they found two wooden toy
horses exactly in scale with the 15-inch marionettes
which were to be used in this play. They began by
taking the horses off their wheeled platforms. These
toy horses were very stiff. In order to enable them to
move their heads, necks, and legs, it was first necessary
to saw off the heads, necks, upper and lower legs.
The drawing shows the way these parts were again attached
so that great freedom of movement was possible.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_p081.jpg' alt='[Marionette]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c014'>For the bear marionette, a teddy bear was used.
Since a teddy bear is very stiff, it was necessary to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>remove all the stuffing from the head, body, and legs.
In order to make the head drop forward, the snout
was weighted with a small three-cornered sack of
shot. The paws were also weighted in order to make
the bear stand naturally. The bear was very lightly
restuffed. The strings were attached to each side of the
head, to the shoulders, lower part of the back, and to
each of the four paws. The marionette was reweighted
no less than four times, in order to get the
right balance to make its movements seem natural
and bearlike.</p>

<p class='c014'>A girl was responsible for the three doves used in
the second scene of <cite>Men of Iron</cite>. She decided upon
the proper scale and then cut a pattern for the body
and another for the wings. The body she made from
soft gray silk and weighted it near the tail. The wings
were wired along their upper edges and then attached
to the body. Each dove required three strings, one
for the center of the back and one for the tip of each
wing.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the <cite>Adventures of Alice</cite>, it was necessary to
have a caterpillar, a frog footman, a Cheshire cat, a
pig baby, a dormouse, and a March hare. The Tenniel
illustrations for <cite>Alice in Wonderland</cite> and <cite>Through
the Looking Glass</cite> were closely followed. The students
who made these animals tried to give to each one the
character which it had in the story. The heads of the
caterpillar, the frog footman, and the March hare
were first modeled in clay. Molds were then made
from these modeled heads. Then papier-mâché heads
were made in just the same way as the papier-mâché
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>heads of the true marionettes. To the papier-mâché
head of the caterpillar was attached a body. Nile-green
silk was used for the upper part and yellow-green
silk for the under part. Half hoops of dress cord
were stitched to the under side of the back, in order
to indicate the segments. A rubber tube for smoke
passed through the body from mouth to tail. Because
the caterpillar was almost human, he was given hands
and arms. The frog footman had a frog’s head, throat,
and webbed hands, and the body of a footman.</p>

<p class='c014'>The March hare had the head and forepaws of a
hare and the body of a country gentleman. He was
made to appear rather simple, credulous and bland.
He had great ears, side burns, and an engaging air,
which belied his occasional impatience. The white
rabbit was brisk and dapper. He was conscious of
his shell-pink ears, fetching whiskers, and the large

<h3 class='c002'><span class='c012'>CHAPTER VI</span><br> Making Your Scenery</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>The stage is made. The puppets have a floor to walk
upon. Is anything more required? You say, “Oh, yes,
there must be scenery before it will be a real stage.”
Who shall plan and make this scenery? Shall this be
the work of one pupil or the work of the whole group?
All will want a share in it. This means that the large
group should be divided into smaller groups and that
each group should be made responsible for a scene.</p>

<p class='c014'>Let us suppose you have dramatized Howard Pyle’s
<cite>Men of Iron</cite> and made a play of four scenes. In order
to give the same note of unity to the scenery that you
are trying to give to your play, every scene must be
in harmony with every other scene and with the whole
idea of the play.</p>

<p class='c014'>Three scenes of <cite>Men of Iron</cite> are laid in Devlin
Castle, England. What do we know about castles and
about English castles? When were castles built? We
go to the library and find books that give us both illustrations
and descriptions. In one of these, Quennell’s
<cite>History of Everyday Things in England</cite>, there are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>drawings and descriptions of castles of the XIth,
XIIth, XIIIth, XIVth, and XVth centuries. The
story of <cite>Men of Iron</cite> is laid in the year 1509. Devlin
Castle had probably seen many generations of the
Mackworth family come and go long before this time.
It probably was built in the XIIIth or early XIVth
century. Let us follow, therefore, the plan of a XIVth
Century castle. On page 86, we find a ground plan
and a picture of such a castle. Read the description
of its massive stone walls and towers, colorless and
gray, and of its courtyard and great hall. The first
scene of the play is laid in the courtyard. The second
scene is laid in the ladies’ garden. The third is laid in
the great hall.</p>

<p class='c014'>Your problem now is to give your audience a picture
of this castle, and the varied life of its courtyard,
its ladies’ garden, and its great hall. On a stage
measuring 30 inches by 55 inches, how can this be
done? If the settings are wisely planned, the audience
will have such a vivid impression of the courtyard, the
garden, and the castle, that they will feel they are living
in the time of the play.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>
<img src='images/i_p086.jpg' alt='[Stage]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c014'>You may be interested in the way a group of boys
and girls planned the stage settings for this play. The
first scene was laid in the courtyard. Instead of trying
to show every little incident and detail of the life of
the courtyard, every stable and blacksmith shop,
every well and water trough, they asked themselves
what important things happened in this first act and
listed them as follows: First, Myles practised at the
pells. Second, the armorer worked in his shop. Third,
Myles played with the squire, and threw a ball over
the wall. Then they took the ground-floor plan of the
XIVth century castle, as they found it in the book,
studied it carefully, and planned this setting. Every
stage setting must give the actors enough room to
move about in. It must have exits. It must be a well-composed
picture. It must be related to the scene
that follows. You can readily see how this careful
planning met each of these requirements: First, it
gave room for their puppets to do what they were required
to do. Second, it gave them the two necessary
exits, one into the castle, the other out to the drawbridge.
Third, it made, by the arrangement of wall,
towers, and armorer’s shop, a well-composed picture.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>Fourth, by this arrangement of the first scene, they
were able to carry the imagination of the audience,
with Myles, when he climbed over the wall, into the
ladies’ garden, in the second scene.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_p087.jpg' alt='[Stage]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Another group planned the second scene. They
imagined themselves on the inside of the garden, on
the other side of the wall shown in the first scene.
They asked themselves, not what do we see, but what
happens in the garden during this scene.</p>

<p class='c014'>First, Lady Anne plays a lute and Lady Alice
dances.</p>

<p class='c014'>Second, Myles tumbles over the wall.</p>

<p class='c014'>Third, the Earl of Mackworth comes from the
castle and returns into the castle.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>Here is the plan they made. You can see how they
planned first to have plenty of floor space for Lady
Alice’s dance, and then, to keep the wall away from
the back drop so that Myles could climb over it.
Second, it provided the necessary exit. Third, through
the arrangement of ivy-covered towers, trellised wall,
and garden bench, it made a charming picture. Fourth,
by means of the exit into the castle, the interest of the
audience was carried into the third scene.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_p088.jpg' alt='[Stage]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Still another group planned the third scene which
is laid in the great hall of the castle. Their purpose
was to make the audience feel the spaciousness of the
great hall and of its galleries and corridors. Again it
was necessary to think of what happened in this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>scene. The first difficulty to present itself was this:
How can enough space be provided for eleven puppets
to be on the stage at the same time, to move about
freely and moreover keep the stage picture beautiful?
A clever boy thought of making a gallery at the side
for Lady Anne and Lady Alice to sit in. This gave
them a place in the picture and enabled their puppeteers
to stand behind the wings of the bridge. Here
they were out of the way of the other nine puppeteers
who stood on the bridge behind the back drop. These
illustrations will show you the floor plan and elevations.
Another boy ingeniously planned the doorway
seen in the elevation, for a rear exit. He made two
back drops. In the rear drop he made a stained-glass
window. The forward drop he made in two parts.
As you can see in the illustration, he placed one section
just a little in front of the other. This provided
space between the two parts, for the passage of the
strings of the king and all the other characters that
should enter from this doorway. To the eyes of the audience
there appeared to be no break in the wall above
the doorway, neither did the eyes of the audience
detect the painting of the tiled floor on the rear back
drop, done in perspective, another bit of cleverness,
which seemed to give width to what otherwise would
have appeared a very narrow corridor. Whenever one
sees a puppet going out through a door, or passing
by outside a window, he is interested, because it gives
the suggestion of life and activity beyond the stage.</p>

<p class='c014'>You have a chance to show yourselves artists in the
placing of doorways and windows. Doorways that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>open upon courtyards, or that give glimpses of distant
landscapes, and windows that open out upon gardens,
are charming details when appropriately used. Avoid,
if possible, painting doors and windows on to your
scenery.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_p090.jpg' alt='[Stage]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The group that made the tournament scene had the
problem of providing plenty of space for the puppet
spectators. It was decided that a very effective scene
could be made by placing the royal box, for the king
and his court, at the rear of the stage. Directly in
front of the box there was space enough for the
tournament. The entrances for this scene were on the
right and left, and were large enough to admit the
horses and their riders. On the back drop was painted
a landscape of the surrounding country, with hills,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>trees, and a distant castle. It usually happens that
certain members of a large group are more drawn to
one scene than to another. If there are too many in
one group, some pupils, realizing the importance of
equalizing the size of the groups, will, good-naturedly,
turn to the assistance of the smaller groups. There
should be boys and girls in each group, and a chairman
selected for each, who will be responsible for his
group. Each chairman meets with his group to discuss
the requirements, general arrangement, and the color
scheme.</p>

<p class='c014'>Do not be in a hurry to begin. Have the impression
you wish to convey to your audience clearly in mind.
Close your eyes. Can you see with your mind’s eye
the place where the scene is laid? Can you see its
color, the movements of your characters, and hear
their voices? Does the picture which comes to your
mind’s eye put you into the mood which you felt when
you first read the story? If it does, you are ready to
begin. Take a sheet of paper about 14 by 17 inches.
Let the rectangle you draw on this be the same proportion
as the proscenium arch. As you plan within
this rectangle, keep in mind the picture your audience
is going to see when your scene is presented.</p>

<p class='c014'>When the plans for a scene have been submitted,
choose the best one, or put all the best ideas into a
new plan. Remember, if you understand proportion,
everything is possible. You can show lofty cliffs that
seem to tower into the air. You can show level plains
that seem to stretch miles to the horizon.</p>

<p class='c014'>When you have finished your plan for each scene,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>you are ready for your tools and materials. Here is a
list of the things usually required:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>Tools</div>
    </div>

      <div class='line'>Brushes</div>
      <div class='line'>Saws, large and very small</div>
      <div class='line'>Screw driver</div>
      <div class='line'>Dye pans</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>Materials</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Beaver board</div>
      <div class='line'>Wood</div>
      <div class='line'>Unbleached muslin</div>
      <div class='line'>Burlap</div>
      <div class='line'>Tacks, nails</div>
      <div class='line'>Screws</div>
      <div class='line'>Dyes</div>
      <div class='line'>Gesso</div>
      <div class='line'>Glue (flake and liquid)</div>
      <div class='line'>Oil colors</div>
      <div class='line'>Water colors by the pound</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Suppose that you belong to the first group. Take
your plan and place it before you. For the back drop,
wall, and wing, you may use beaver board, heavy
paper, canvas, or muslin stiffened by a thin coat of
boiled starch. Now go to your stage and measure the
height and width of the back drop and the wing
frames. Then cut out the back drop and wing from
the material you have chosen. Place these in their
positions on the stage. Take a piece of charcoal, or
soft lead pencil, and lightly sketch your design onto
the back drop and wing. Now step back, at least ten
feet, in order to see if your arrangement, perspective,
and scale are correct. You may find that your distant
tower is too large or too small, or that your trees are
too small or too tall, or that your arrangement is not
according to your well-worked-out plan. Make your
corrections. Then take the back drop and wing from
the stage, and lay them flat on desks or tables. With
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>your scenery in this position carefully complete your
sketch.</p>

<p class='c014'>Now take a piece of white chalk and draw on the
stage floor the ground plan. If the tower nearest the
front is made large, and the one farther away slightly
smaller, you will get the effect of distance. You will
observe that the larger tower is not round, although
it appears so to the audience. By making it flat at the
back, you gain floor space for the marionettes that
may be waiting to go on the stage. The bases and
tops of these towers are of wood; the sides are of strips
of wood which serve as a foundation for the burlap
cover. The armorer’s shop, too, may be made of
wood and beaver board. The effect of stone may be
produced by covering the surface of these towers,
walls, and shop with a mixture of sand and gesso.</p>

<p class='c020'><i>Colors.</i> When you are ready to paint the scenery,
you can use ordinary house paints, showcard colors, or
water colors. House paints are ready mixed. Water
colors are practical and inexpensive when bought in
powder form, but when you use them you should add
several tablespoonfuls of a fixative made from flake
glue dissolved in water. Various kinds of showcard
colors are clear and pure and very easy to use, but
they are comparatively expensive. If you cannot
afford many colors buy red, yellow, dark blue, and
white. By combining them you can get a wide range
of colors. If you are not limited in the amount you can
spend, add to your list orange, light green, light blue,
mauve, and magenta.</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span><i>Color Mixing.</i> You probably know something about
color and the mixing of colors. However, you may
find the following directions helpful. First let us experiment
with yellow. If you add a very little bit of
blue to the yellow you can see the yellow turning to
greenish-yellow. As you gradually add more blue
you can see the greenish-yellow turning to yellow-green
and finally to green.</p>

<p class='c014'>Let us begin again with pure yellow. If you add a
very little bit of red to the yellow you can see the
yellow turning to orange-yellow. As you gradually
add more red, you can see the orange-yellow turning to
yellow-orange and finally to orange.</p>

<p class='c014'>Let us begin once more with pure yellow. If you
add a very little bit of blue and red to the yellow, you
can see the yellow turning to a grayish-yellow. As you
gradually add more blue and red you can see the
grayish-yellow turning to yellowish-gray, and finally
turning to a neutral gray.</p>

<p class='c014'>Let us experiment with red. If you add a little bit
of yellow to the red you can see the red turning to
yellowish-red. As you gradually add more you can
see the yellowish-red turning to reddish-orange, and
finally to orange.</p>

<p class='c014'>Let us begin again with pure red. If you add a very
little bit of blue to the red you can see the red turning
to a bluish-red. As you gradually add more blue you
can see the bluish-red turning to reddish-purple and
finally to purple.</p>

<p class='c014'>Let us begin once more with pure red. If you add a
very little bit of yellow and blue to the red you can see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>the red turning to a grayish-red. As you gradually add
more yellow and blue you can see the grayish-red
turning to reddish-gray and finally turning to a
neutral gray.</p>

<p class='c014'>Let us experiment with blue. If you add a little bit
of yellow to the blue you can see the blue turning to
greenish-blue. As you gradually add more yellow you
can see the greenish-blue turning to bluish-green and
finally to green.</p>

<p class='c014'>Let us begin again with pure blue. If you add a very
little bit of red to the blue you can see the blue turning
to a reddish-blue. As you gradually add more red
you can see the reddish-blue turning to bluish-purple
and finally to purple.</p>

<p class='c014'>Let us begin once more with pure blue. If you add a
very little bit of yellow and red to the blue you can
see the blue turning to a grayish-blue. As you gradually
add more yellow and red you can see the grayish-blue
turning to bluish-gray and finally turning to a
neutral gray.</p>

<p class='c014'>Brown, which is not a pure color, is made by adding
a little blue to orange. There are yellow-browns and
red-browns, but some blue is used in making every one
of them.</p>

<p class='c020'><i>Value and Intensity.</i> What do these technical terms:
“Color Value” and “Color Intensity” mean to you?
There is a certain satisfaction in understanding their
meanings and in being able to use them correctly.
Value refers to the amount of light reflected by a
color. Light red is lighter in value than dark red. A
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>color is always made lighter in value by the addition
of white. Intensity refers to the strength or brilliancy
of a color. Pure red is intense. When a little yellow or
blue is added to it, it becomes a grayish-red, and consequently
is less intense. If white is added to pure red,
its intensity is lessened.</p>

<p class='c020'><i>Brushes.</i> For the painting of the scenery you will
need several brushes of different sizes, varying in
width from the small sable brush to the inch or inch
and a half bristle brush. Use large brushes whenever
possible. Work from left to right, using horizontal
strokes or vertical downward strokes. Brushes are
expensive, and should be given excellent care and
thoroughly cleaned after using.</p>

<p class='c014'>Let us suppose that you are ready to paint the
scenery for <cite>Men of Iron</cite>. Let us take Scene I:
what is the time of year and what is the hour of the
day? You answer, “It is a day of sunshine, in early
spring.” Spring skies are clear and may be painted
light blue; the trees may be painted yellow-green with
splashes of pure yellow to give an effect of sunlight.
The castle towers, wall, and armor shop, should be
painted a warm neutral gray. An occasional touch of
darker gray at the top of wall, windows, and tower
suggests thickness and adds to the illusion you are
creating. The distant castle tower on the back drop
should be painted a lighter gray because it is far
away.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the second scene, the time of year is midsummer,
and the time of day is mid-afternoon. Therefore, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>sky was painted a deeper blue than that of the first
scene. The trees were painted a richer green; the
flowers were painted in brilliant colors. The castle
walls and towers were painted a yellowish-gray, while
the vines that clambered over them were painted a
rich green. In order to carry the imagination of the
audience into the castle, a circling stairway was
painted on the right wing. The audience caught a
glimpse of this stairway at the right of the tower.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the third scene, which is laid in the great hall,
the back drop, wings, and walls were painted a lighter
gray than the outside walls. Sand and gesso were
mixed with the gray paint in order to give the suggestion
of rough stone. The great stone walls, as you
know, made the old castles cold and colorless. This
coldness was relieved by stained-glass windows, rich
tapestries, hangings, and colorful costumes.</p>

<p class='c014'>The boy who painted the tapestry for this scene
went to books and to the old tapestries in the art museum
for his inspiration. He produced the effect of
rich tapestry by painting directly on the beaver board,
with thin vertical strokes of pure color. Another
student produced the effect of stained glass by making
a design on tracing paper, painting it on both sides
with water colors, and then fastening it to the window
opening in the back drop. Manila, Haytol, or oak
tag paper may be used instead of tracing paper; you
can make them translucent by brushing both sides
with a little linseed oil after the water colors are dry.
A light placed behind these stained-glass windows
brings out their designs and colors.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>In the fourth act, which is the tournament scene,
the time of year is late summer, the time of day is late
afternoon. On the back drop was painted a landscape
of the surrounding country, hills, trees, and a distant
castle. The sky was painted a pale gold to signify the
success of Myles in the combat. The royal box and
fence were painted a dark earth brown. The box was
enriched with gold and colorful hangings.</p>

<p class='c014'>These directions are not meant to be followed. They
are merely offered as suggestions, to assist you in
meeting the problems your play may present. Every
boy and girl ought to feel free enough, in every phase
of his work, to express his own ideas. This should be
equally true in arranging or writing a play, in making
a marionette, in planning and constructing properties
and scenery, and in experimenting with lighting. Few
pleasures in life compare with the pleasure of creating
something. In planning your scenery, much depends
upon the plan and the type of stage you have chosen.
No matter what the play or what the stage, you can
make no mistake if you keep your backgrounds simple.
Some of the greatest artists use no scenery. They
produce their effects simply by means of curtains and
lighting. Begin your experiment by using curtains.
A light gray curtain for a back drop and the sides of
your stage can give many charming effects, as you
will discover when you begin experimenting with
colored lights.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>Few things will show your judgment and good taste
more than your scenery, which must be first, last,
and always, a background for the marionettes. This
means that it must be either lighter or darker than
the puppets, so that they can be seen against it. It
must be so simple that the eye can follow the marionette
easily, and not be lost in the detail of the background,
which will happen if there are too many
colors, and the colors are not of the same value. The
scenery should not be an end in itself, but should be
a beautiful setting for the marionettes, and by its
fitness give an added sense of the beauty of your
play.</p>

<p><i>How to pull your curtains. Attach central ring of one curtain at A and the central ring of the other at B. Pulling string C closes the curtains, while D opens them.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>So far we have not thought of the frame for our
stage, which is called the proscenium, nor have we
spoken of the stage curtains. These are important because
they are what might be called an introduction
to the play. If they strike the right note, they may
even hold the thread of interest between the acts. It
is usual to have a contrast between the proscenium
and the curtains, and between the proscenium and
the several settings of the play. If your play has
several brightly lighted scenes, you will probably find
that a gray proscenium with a very simple, appropriate
design looks much better than a brightly colored
one with elaborate designs. Use the same good taste
in framing your stage picture as you would in framing
any other picture. Grays, yellows, and dull gold are
always pleasing. The best material to use for the
curtains is unbleached muslin. Because it takes dye so
beautifully, it sometimes comes to have the look of the
richest old velvet. It should be thoroughly soaked in
hot water and then rubbed between the hands before
dipping in the dye bath. The selvedges should be
gathered together and then the entire piece should
be wrung out. The dye bath should be ready. If you
wish a plain color you may dip the entire piece,
usually four yards, two for each curtain, at one time.
If, however, you wish to have the curtains darker at
the bottom than at the top, you must allow the lower
part to remain longer in the dye bath. As you gain experience
in dyeing, you may wish to use two or even
three different dyes for your curtains. The curtains
for <cite>Sigurd, the Volsung</cite>, kept the same color
symbolism as the costumes. The upper part was
yellow to symbolize the wisdom of Odin, running
into orange to symbolize the home ties of the Volsung
line, and into deep red at the bottom, symbolizing
the valor and courage of the hero, Sigurd. The curtains
for <cite>Men of Iron</cite> were red at the top to symbolize
the valor of Myles, then purple to symbolize
the royal blood of the Mackworths, black at the
bottom to symbolize the deceit, overthrow, and
death of the Earl of Alban. Until you have acquired
skill in dyeing it is best to hold to very simply colored
curtains. These may be either in harmony with or in
contrast to the color you have chosen for the proscenium.
The curtains should never be ironed. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>should be smoothed out with the hands, when the
muslin is still very damp, then hung up to dry. Hem
carefully at the top and bottom, fold into pleats at
the top. Small brass rings should then be sewed on to
every pleat for the curtain strings to pass through.
To the bottom of the curtain small dress weights
should be fastened every five or six inches just under
each curtain ring. Crease the folds with your hands.
Your curtain may come to have its own way of looking
just right—of behaving properly when it has its
part to do, and may add the last note of craftsmanship
and perfection to your scenery.</p>

<h3 class='c002'><span class='c012'>CHAPTER VII</span><br> Making Your Properties</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>Puppets usually require a few well-chosen properties.
These should be in scale with the puppets,
and serve some practical need. Properties should be
similar to the things used in the time of your play, in
the country of your play, and by the class or classes
of people represented in your play.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is well to be familiar with the life, customs, and
manners of the people who lived at the time of your
play. The library, historical museum, and art museum
are sources of information. First, there is the
library in which there are always books and pictures
and a wealth of information for your use. Take several
pieces of tracing paper with you when you go
there, also several well-sharpened pencils, and your
colored crayons. When you find a suitable illustration,
make a sketch or a tracing of it and careful color
notes.</p>

<p class='c014'>Let us suppose that you are about to make the
properties for <cite>Men of Iron.</cite> Take the story and from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>it make a list of the properties that you will need.
You will probably make a list somewhat like this:</p>

<p class='c019'>Act I—Courtyard. Properties required:</p>

  <dl class='dl_5'>
    <dt>1.</dt>
    <dd>Bench for the squires to sit upon and later for Myles to stand upon.
    </dd>
    <dt>2.</dt>
    <dd>An upright post, or pell, to be used by Myles when he practises with his sword.
    </dd>
    <dt>3.</dt>
    <dd>An anvil to be placed in the armorer’s shop.
    </dd>

<p class='c018'>The bench in Scene I was made of wood and was a

<p class='c014'>Sometimes there are properties and effects that
take special ingenuity and skill. Many boys have
unusual ability in solving these problems. In the
first scene of <cite>Men of Iron</cite> an anvil was needed. One
boy asked to be responsible for the anvil. There was a
miniature anvil in the classroom that had been used
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>the year before by the class that had given <cite>Sigurd, the
Volsung</cite>. Now, what did he do? First, he drilled two
holes into the top of the anvil and placed a strip of
mica on the iron between the holes. Then he attached
a thin coil of wire, about the size of that in an electric
toaster, screwed it down into the holes, where it met
the charged wires which came up through the holes in
the anvil. When the current was turned on, the coil
glowed red. This boy also made a hammer, which he
fastened in the hand of the puppet armorer. From
the hammer a long wire stretched upward to the controller,
and then down behind the scenes to the socket.
When the armorer struck the anvil with his hammer,
brilliant sparks flew in every direction. Care was
taken to strike the broad surface of the anvil top and
to avoid striking the coil of wire. You will notice that
he placed the mica and coil close to the edge, in order
to give the armorer plenty of room for the strokes of
his hammer.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_p104.jpg' alt='[Anvil]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The garden bench in Act II was made by a pupil
who had made a special study of gardens. When one
of the boys found that a lute was needed for this scene,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>he went to the art museum where he had the good
fortune to find two lutes, a large one and a small one,
both of Italian make. He then went to the historical
museum where he found pictures of similar lutes used
in England, in the time of his play. He now decided
to use the large lute in the museum as a model for the
lute of his minstrel, and the smaller one for Lady
Alice. He then made careful drawings to scale, proceeded
to carve the instruments from wood, and to
stain them, and enrich them with gold. When they
were finished, with the little detail of strings, they
were such an exquisite note of perfection that they
added much to the beauty of the scene, and gave a
thrill of delight to all who saw them.</p>

<p class='c014'>In Act III, a Gothic throne and a Gothic chest were
needed. The boy who was responsible for these went
to the art museum to look for Gothic furniture. He
found a Gothic chest, and adapted its proportions and
design to both the throne and the chest. He copied a
XVth Century stool for the minstrel to sit upon. The
carpet and hangings for this scene were made from
large scraps of rich crimson velvet given by a generous
upholsterer.</p>

<p class='c014'>In Act IV, the royal box was historically true, as it
was made from drawings of a royal box found in an
old illuminated manuscript. It was constructed from
wood and beaver board. Tapestries hung from the
front of the box and pennants from tall poles at the
corners.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sometimes, when scenery has been especially well
designed, it makes properties almost unnecessary.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>For instance, in the throne room of King Elf in
<cite>Sigurd, the Volsung</cite> the background is a dark,
richly colored tapestry. Against this was placed the
throne on a raised dais. With this single property the
scene was a satisfying picture. When the three fair-haired
maidens, dressed in white and gold, with flowing
veils of pale rose, came to present the baby
Sigurd to King Elf, it was a lovely picture.</p>

<p class='c014'>The materials used for making properties are
usually wood, cardboard, tacks, glue, ½-inch linen or
cotton tape, papier-mâché, gesso, and paints. The
tools needed are hammer, coping saw, scissors, and a
sharp knife. Drawings should be kept before the
worker for constant reference. They are his guide for
proportion, design, and scale.</p>

<p class='c014'>Accidents are as likely to happen in puppet families
and at puppet parties as they are to happen in our
homes and at our own parties. If the chairs are unsteady
and the tables too light, they may cause
trouble and embarrassment. Think what might have
happened at Bob Kratchet’s Christmas party in
Charles Dickens’ <cite>Christmas Carol</cite>, when all the
puppets sat down to the well-laden table, if some
thought had not been given to making it secure. How
do you imagine this was done? The table and all the
chairs were glued to a large piece of cardboard. When
the scene was set, this was placed on the stage. In
the time of Bob Kratchet, just as in our own time,
houses contained many pieces of furniture and other
things of daily use. Imagine what would happen,
if we made all the properties that are mentioned in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>the story and then tried to crowd them on to the stage.
There would be no room for the puppets to move
about in. Our eyes would be confused with details
and the picture would be ruined. Here is a list of the
properties that were chosen by the group of children
who gave <cite>The Childhood of David Copperfield</cite>:</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>Nearly all properties need some decoration. Some
need color, others need merely stain. Occasionally it
is necessary to give the effect of carved wood. This is
necessary in plays of the Middle Ages like <cite>Sigurd,
the Volsung</cite>, and <cite>Men of Iron</cite>, where your properties
represent old wood carving. Gesso may be used
to suggest this carving. Gesso was used by the craftsmen
of the Middle Ages, especially in Italy, for enriching
surfaces. This is the formula for making it: 2
tablespoons of varnish, 12 tablespoons of glue (best
quality), 8 tablespoons of linseed oil. Mix these three
ingredients together and allow to stand. In a separate
dish put 20 rounded tablespoons full of whiting and
then mix with water until it is the consistency of
thick cream. Pour this into your first mixture and
cook in a double boiler for ten minutes, stirring constantly.
Then pour into a bottle and cork tightly. The
gesso is now ready for use.</p>

<p class='c014'>Work out your design and then draw it carefully
upon the chair, chest, or throne which you mean to
decorate. Apply the gesso with a small brush. Be very
careful to keep well within the line of your design.
The gesso will give you a pattern in relief. You must
keep each surface flat for at least 12 hours, or until
dry. If the design is not high enough when it is dry, a
second coat may be applied. When you have covered
all the parts which are to be painted and the gesso is
dry, rub it over with a bit of oil paint mixed in these
proportions: ¾ of ivory black, ¼ of burnt sienna thinned
with a little turpentine. After the oil paint has
dried, add a coat of dull finishing wax and rub down.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>

<img src='images/i_p109.jpg' alt='[Fountain]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c014'>A fountain is a most effective and beautiful device.
When placed in a garden, surrounded by miniature
ferns and flowers, with birds singing, and soft colored
lights playing upon its jetting water, it makes a
scene of enchantment. Fountains are very simply
made as you can see in this illustration. A low cake
tin, with a hollow tin centerpiece, a funnel, and a
piece of ¾-inch rubber tubing about six feet long, are
the only materials necessary.</p>

<p class='c014'>Occasionally there is a need for smoke. In the play
of <cite>Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp</cite>, the genii appear
out of a cloud of smoke. In <cite>Sigurd, the Volsung</cite>,
the dragon may be made to breathe forth
smoke. In the <cite>Adventures of Alice</cite>, you may remember
the old caterpillar who sits on a toadstool
and smokes his pipe. Smoke can be made from
ammonia and hydrochloric acid. The illustration
shows how this is done. In order to make the dragon
breathe forth smoke, a rubber tube was run through
its body from mouth to tail. The end that extended
from the tail was connected with the tube that came
from the bottles. When a boy blew through the tube,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>smoke came from the dragon’s mouth. In the marionette
play of <cite>Aladdin and His Wonderful Lamp</cite>, a
hole was bored through the stage floor at the spot
where the genie was to appear. At the clap of thunder
that announced the genie’s appearance, a cloud of
smoke poured forth.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_p110.jpg' alt='[Lamp]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c014'>In the <cite>Adventures of Alice</cite>, when the caterpillar
was made, a tube was run through his body from tail
to mouth. When this tube was attached to the bottle
tube, and the lazy old fellow took his pipe in his
mouth, he appeared to blow out great puffs of smoke
to the surprise and delight of everyone.</p>

<p class='c014'>The toadstool was such a nice property that you
may wish to know how it was constructed. The girl
who made it found some beautiful pictures of toadstools
in an old number of the <cite>National Geographic</cite>.
She chose one of interesting shape and color as her
model, and reproduced it with papier-mâché. When
it was quite dry, she colored it to represent the
illustration. It was winter time when this play was
given. Had it been any other season, she could have
gone to the woods and fields and searched out a
beautiful specimen which would have served her purpose
much better than the illustration.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>Fireplaces and stoves are comparatively modern
inventions. Braziers were used in earlier times. They
consisted of a metal tripod and a basin to hold the
coals. A brazier could be used appropriately in a
Greek or Roman play, or in a play of the Middle Ages.
The tripod could be made of wire or of tin. The basin
could be made of tin, wood, or papier-mâché. Both
the tripod and the basin should be painted to imitate
bronze or iron. A tiny red bulb can be fastened into the
center of the basin, and attached to a wire leading
down from the tripod, through the stage floor. Slightly
conceal the bulb with small bits of wood. The warm
light from this brazier will throw a glow on the face
of a marionette, who is warming his hands over it.</p>

<p class='c014'>A marionette may carry a lantern. This marionette
lantern may be made from any small tin or cardboard
box. Find some pictures of old lanterns suitable for
your play, and then make a lantern as much like the
illustration as you can. A pattern of holes should be
punched in the sides. A tiny electric bulb may be
fastened inside the lantern and its wire carried up to
the controller and from there to the battery.</p>

<p class='c014'>Properties should be made in a craftsmanlike way.
A craftsman respects his materials and his tools. He
cleans his brushes and palette as soon as he finishes
the work of the day, and puts his materials in order
for the next day’s work. He never hurries. His reward
is his satisfaction in the excellence of his work.</p>

<h3 class='c002'><span class='c012'>CHAPTER VIII</span><br> Lighting Your Stage</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>Let us imagine that we are seated in a dimly lighted
theater. The signal rings. The curtains open and
what do we see? People. What makes them visible?
Light. What makes the color? Light. What makes the
interesting shadows? Light. It is light that does all
these things, makes the picture visible and carries
our thoughts and feelings into the play which is
about to begin.</p>

<p class='c014'>By what means is all this done? By means of footlights,
overhead lights, movable strips of lights, and
movable spotlights. A few years ago every stage was
lighted by footlights only. These lights threw a crude
glare on to the faces of the actors and sometimes made
large ugly shadows on the back drop. Later, when
overhead lights were used with footlights, there were
no shadows at all. This was equally bad. The majority
of people did not seem to mind this, but when certain
artists went to the theater, they began to ask themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>whether there might not be some way of
remedying the glare of the footlights and of managing
the shadows. These artists began to experiment.
They made little stages, took the footlights away,
and began, by means of arc lights, to light their
stages indirectly. They began to use movable spotlights
behind the scenes, and to fasten lights on to
strips of wood and place these strips wherever they
felt they were necessary.</p>

<p class='c014'>They made further experiments. They covered
their lights with pieces of different colored silks and
gelatine. This not only removed the glare of the lights
but produced new and very interesting effects. Next
they turned to Nature and began to observe how she
produced her wonderful effects. They discovered
that these usually came in the soft light of early
morning and late evening, in twilight and moonlight,
and not in the strong garish light of mid-day. With
these observations in mind, they went to work to reproduce
some of these effects. The result of their
experiments is that, to-day, we see stage pictures as
beautiful as pictures painted by the finest artists.
Lighting has now come to be such an important factor
in the producing of plays that no stage, however
small, can ignore it.</p>

<p class='c014'>Let us now consider the kind of lighting which
may be used in the several kinds of marionette stages.
The Punch and Judy stage requires no lighting when
used in daylight. But even this stage requires some
thought for its lighting when it is used in a darkened
room. Your set of Christmas-tree lights may be fastened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>to the top of the proscenium arch and an extension
light may be used in the same way as is shown
in the illustration. Christmas-tree lights and extension
lights are all that are necessary for the table stage
and the soap-box stage. In the chapter on “Making
Your Stage” you will see how these lights are placed.</p>

<p class='c014'>If you have made the semi-professional stage with
overhead lights, footlights, and strips, you are ready
to experiment with your lighting. Begin by asking
yourself whether the scenes of your play take place
indoors or out of doors. What is the time of day and
the season of the year? Is it an out-of-door scene, representing
the cold of winter, or the heat of summer?
Does your scene occur in the soft light of early morning
or in the glow of sunset? Is your scene laid in a
deep cool wood or in a warm sunny garden? All of
these questions must be considered.</p>

<p class='c014'>Now, how can you produce these varied effects of
sunlight and moonlight, coldness and warmth, somberness
and gaiety? Certain colors such as red, orange,
and yellow are called warm colors, because they give
the feeling of warmth. Other colors such as green,
blue, and violet are called cool, because they give the
feeling of coolness. If your scene suggests warmth,
whether indoors or out of doors, begin experimenting
with warm lights, ambers, reds, and yellows. You will
find that usually a certain number of white lights are
needed with the colored lights in order to produce the
effects you seek.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_p114a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic003'>
<p><i>Marionette Ballet, "Petroushka"</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>Everyone knows that color produces varied emotions.
We are familiar with the effects of red which
are stimulating, exciting, or irritating. The toreador,
recognizing this principle, waves a flaming red mantle
before the bull. Blue has an exactly opposite effect.
It quiets and soothes, and when it runs into violet,
it becomes depressing. Experiment with purple lights
and you will find that they give a note of gloom,
mystery, or of impending disaster. Yellow is the color
that brings gaiety and light-heartedness, as you will
recall when you contrast your own feelings on a sunshiny
day and on a gray day.</p>

<p class='c014'>You will find that most out-of-door effects are produced
by soft natural lighting which gives a sense of
distance and perspective to the scene. For this effect
use yellow, amber, and white lights with an occasional
blue or red. Only lights coming from several directions
will produce the subtle tones of nature. This means
using footlights with discretion, stronger lights overhead,
and placing strips wherever you need them in
order to destroy the shadows which other lights may
throw. Sometimes it takes several hours of experimenting
to find the right lighting for a single scene.
It means changing the position of the strips, using
more lighting or less lighting, and always asking yourself
whether your lighting is just that which your
scene demands to bring out its mood. The shadows
produced by footlights may sometimes be used to give
charm or mystery to a scene. For instance, in the
second scene in the <cite>Petrouchka Ballet</cite>, only footlights
were used. The pattern of the shadows of the dancers
falling on a neutral background was very effective.</p>

<p class='c014'>If your scene is laid indoors, your lighting will be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>somewhat determined by the period of the play. For
instance, in the third act of <cite>Men of Iron</cite>, the great
hall of Devlin Castle was softly lighted to suggest
candle and torch light. This effect was produced by
using amber and blue lights overhead; red, blue, white,
and amber in the footlights. A strip of blue and red
lights placed upright against the proscenium frame
threw rich color against the king and those of his
courtiers who stood near the throne. This color was
most pleasing when it fell upon the armor of Myles as
he knelt before the king.</p>

<p class='c014'>Again your lighting may be determined by the kind
of action. A gay scene naturally requires bright
lighting. As an illustration of this: The royal kitchen
in the <cite>Knave of Hearts</cite> was made warm and gay
by the use of white and amber lights overhead, and
amber, blue, and red footlights to throw rich colors
on the costumes. The fireplace gave a warm light, and
through the window could be seen the bright summer
landscape.</p>

<p class='c014'>As an illustration of a serious and somber scene, we
might take the first act of the hero tale, <cite>Sigurd, the
Volsung</cite>. Here many blue lights were used with a
very few red and amber. The result was that the great
hall became a mysterious place in which Odin himself
could appear, and a somber enough setting for the
traitorous Siggeir.</p>

<p class='c014'>If your picture is an imaginative one, such as the
garden of jewels in <cite>Aladdin and His Wonderful
Lamp</cite>, you are free to use your lights as you wish,
to produce a scene of enchantment.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>When you have finished your experimenting, and
have found the right lighting for a scene, take a sheet
of paper and make a chart. This illustration suggests
a form for you to follow.</p>

<p class='c018'>The stage electrician will need a chart for each scene
of your play. The changing of the lights for each
scene will be his responsibility.</p>

<p class='c014'>You will probably have little need for baby-spots
unless your equipment is very elaborate, and to use
them requires almost professional experience. Every
boy who is interested in electricity knows that a
rheostat or dimmer is used for turning lights off and
on gradually. They may be purchased for a small sum
or they may be made.</p>

<p class='c014'>Every new play and every new scene presents a
new problem for you to solve. You will know that you
have solved your problem when, as a group, you can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>sit before each scene and feel that it is harmonious,
that it surrounds the figures with suitable atmosphere,
and that your lighting interprets the idea and mood of
your play.</p>

<p><i>From A the current from one wire passes to the stationary electrode C which is submerged in a gallon jar of water containing one eighth teaspoon of ammonium chloride.

By means of the cord (attached to the screw eye in B) which runs over the pulleys D, D down to the spool drum E, the upper electrodes can be slowly let down into the ammonium chloride solution, completing the circuit and increasing it as more of the electrode surface is exposed to the liquid.

<h3 class='c002'><span class='c012'>CHAPTER IX</span><br> Training Your Puppeteers</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>The stage is set. The play has been chosen. The
puppets are ready. Let us gather around the table to
talk about our parts. There should be a copy of the
play in the hands of each puppeteer. Begin by reading
the play, each pupil reading the part that he has
chosen. After the reading, discuss and analyze each
character, his appearance, his disposition, and his
voice.</p>

<p class='c014'>For instance, Captain Peggoty in <cite>The Childhood
of David Copperfield</cite> would have a rough-and-ready
seaman’s voice that would boom from his deep chest,
but his words would show generosity and kindness. Alice,
in <cite>Alice in Wonderland</cite> would have a little girl’s
voice, one that would suggest wonderment, sometimes
impatience, and a quaint dignity when she tried to
appear grown up. The White Rabbit’s voice would be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>high, nervous, and impatient. The Caterpillar would
have a slow, full, dignified voice, while the voice of
the Duchess would be gruff and peppery. Deacon
Bowman, the faithful old servant in <cite>Men of Iron</cite>,
would have the trembling, wavering voice of extreme
old age.</p>

<p class='c014'>How shall the right person be found for each part?
One of the most satisfactory ways is that of trying out
for parts, with the group acting as a jury. The judges
must keep in mind that the voice is very important
in interpreting character and they will do well to
choose the voice that is best suited to the character.
If each puppeteer takes the same position at the
table at each rehearsal, you will soon associate each
voice with a certain place. This will make it much
easier to address your lines to the proper character.
The lines should be reread slowly for the sake of
better understanding. In this way, each in turn soon
comes to read the lines of his character with real
appreciation. Do not hurry over the little words.
Every word should be clearly spoken. Lift your eyes
as often as you can from your manuscript. “Talk”
your lines. In almost no time you will know your
lines without looking at them. When you can speak
your lines so naturally that any of your friends, with
his eyes closed, could imagine the character you are
interpreting from your voice, you are ready to take
your puppet in hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>Manipulation of your marionette is the second step
in your training as a puppeteer. You will be surprised
at the amount of time this requires. Some of the greatest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>puppeteers have spent months learning to manage
a single puppet. In all your practice work, avoid careless
motions of your hands, with your thoughts elsewhere.
Be wholly absorbed in what you wish to do.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_p121a.jpg' alt='[Marionettes]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_p121b.jpg' alt='[Marionettes]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Your puppet in the making has been so weighted
that when you hold your controller you will know
the very second the puppet’s feet touch the floor.
This delicate position must be held. Hold your controller
steady. If you lower your controller after the
feet have touched the floor your puppet will sag. Behold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>the sagging puppet! Begin gently. Do not jerk
the strings. The least motion of the hand brings a
quick response from the puppet. In fact, puppets are
just like ourselves, if handled skilfully they will do
almost anything you may wish them to do. As your
skill grows so will your pleasure in your puppet grow.
Its many almost human movements and gestures will
delight you as they have delighted all those men and
women who have been its friends. If you can hold
your marionette before a mirror and practise with it,
speaking your lines, as you pull the strings, you will
be surprised to see how lifelike it becomes. You will
discover that a slight movement may indicate very
strong feeling.</p>

<p class='c014'>A whole chapter could be written about the movements
of the head. Let us see how the head may show
thoughtfulness. When you are thoughtful, how do
you hold your head? Release the head strings and
your puppet’s head will drop forward as yours has
just done. If you wish to turn this thoughtful pose
into one of discouragement, let the shoulders droop
forward as well, so that the chest becomes hollow.
How would you stand if listening? Release the head
strings and slant the controller so that the head falls
a little to one side and a little forward. How near to
this and yet how different is the attitude of craftiness
and cunning. To the listening pose you simply add a
forward thrust of the head and a hunching up of the
shoulders. For the proud, erect bearing of a king,
hold your controller horizontally. If your puppet is
a charming young lady, her head will make many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>quick, graceful little turns. This may be done by releasing
the head strings and tipping the controller
back and forth.</p>

<p class='c014'>We now come to the movements of the shoulders
and the waist. The center string controls the movements
of the waist and is used whenever you want
your puppet to sit down, kneel down, or bow. As you
know there are a hundred different ways of sitting
down. The young and old, each has his way. So, too,
have the proud and the humble, the gentle and the
boisterous. When you make your puppet sit down, unless
he is very stiff and proud, let his body settle a
little. You will notice that most people do this. When
you pull the center string you must at the same time
lower the controller slightly to keep the feet from
swinging off the floor.</p>

<p class='c014'>There are quite as many ways of bowing as there
are of sitting down. A courtier would bow from the
waist, his head slightly bent; the little princess, in
her full skirts, would courtesy gracefully with her
head tilted backward.</p>

<p class='c014'>Next, we come to that small but important thing,
the hand. When one knows how to control it, it can
do such wonderful things. It can show force or gentleness,
harshness or kindness, nervous excitement or
shaky old age. It is possible for a marionette to draw
a sword, practise at the pells, engage in fist fights,
and hammer at a forge. When a marionette must
hammer at a forge, as in <cite>Sigurd, the Volsung</cite>,
and in <cite>Men of Iron</cite>, be sure that it makes a heavy,
steady stroke. The hammer must be of iron. If the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>armorer sings a jolly rhythmic song, he can keep
time with his hammer. Suit your gestures to your
words. It is the fault of inexperienced puppeteers that
they make all gestures alike. Experienced puppeteers
suit their gestures to the ideas and to the feelings
which they wish to convey.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is when a puppet is called upon to do some unusual
thing, such as dancing, climbing a wall, fighting
a duel, riding a horse in a tournament, that difficulties
appear.</p>

<p class='c014'>Let us take the first of these—dancing. The Bear in
<cite>Men of Iron</cite> danced. Dainty little Lady Alice in
<cite>Men of Iron</cite> danced. Fat jolly Tweedle Dee in
<cite>Alice in Wonderland</cite> danced. The surly old cook
in the Duchess’s kitchen danced. But imagine the
differences in these dances! Each dance expressed the
character of the dancer. The Bear danced to a lively
jig whistled by his trainer. His steps were carefully
worked out in time with the tune, and when once
learned were never varied. Little Lady Alice, with
dainty step and charming courtesies, danced to the
tune of a medieval love song. Tweedle Dee danced
to a rollicking tune played on an accordion. His steps
were lively and when he danced across the stage on
his right foot, kicking out his left in time with the
music, he made everyone laugh. The cook’s dance was
an Irish jig.</p>

<p class='c014'>Puppets are versatile. To them belongs not only
the interpretation of the spoken word but they are
equally at home in the world of pantomime, music,
and dance.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>The illustrations in this book show how puppets
can even perform a ballet. Here you can see their interpretation
of the colorful and dramatic Russian
ballet, <cite>Petrouchka</cite>. The cast of twenty-one puppets
included four principal actors, the manager, the Moor,
the Ballerina, and Petrouchka and besides these, a
showman and a trained bear, an organ grinder, and
bands of gypsies.</p>

<p class='c014'>A ballet or an opera will naturally require a different
procedure than a play, because the character
analysis comes from the music. Here are the steps by
which the <cite>Petrouchka Ballet</cite> was worked out:</p>

<p class='c014'>1. The story was told to the pupils.</p>

<p class='c014'>2. The musical score as a whole was played to
them.</p>

<p class='c014'>3. The motif for each character and incident was
played to them.</p>

<p class='c014'>4. The musical score as a whole was again played
and the pupils listened for the motifs.</p>

<p class='c014'>5. Each character was analyzed and his probable
actions upon the stage were discussed.</p>

<p class='c014'>6. The puppet was taken in hand and the interpretation
of the music with it was begun.</p>

<p class='c014'>There are four scenes in this ballet. The first scene
is a street fair in a Russian village. A little theater
occupies the center back stage in which the stage
manager exhibits the Moor, the Ballerina, and
Petrouchka. The scene closes with their lively dance
and Petrouchka’s declaration of love to the Ballerina.</p>

<p class='c014'>Scene II is in Petrouchka’s box and shows his despairing
love for the Ballerina.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>Scene III is in the Moor’s box and shows him playing
with his ball. The Ballerina enters and they dance
together. Petrouchka rushes in and in a jealous rage
tries to kill the Moor. The Moor chases Petrouchka
out of his box.</p>

<p class='c014'>Scene IV is again at the fair. There are gay dances
by gypsies and nounous. Petrouchka runs in, chased
by the Moor who stabs him. The people draw away
and the Ballerina kneels beside him. The manager
comes in, the Moor, the Ballerina, and all the people
depart. The manager drags poor, lifeless Petrouchka
toward the little theater. Suddenly up over the little
theater appears the spirit of Petrouchka, mocking
and gesticulating. The manager stands aghast.</p>

<p class='c014'>So that you may understand how this ballet was
produced, let us take the second scene and work it
out together. The scene opens with a crashing chord
as Petrouchka is thrown onto the stage. (No less than
thirty times did the puppeteer rehearse this entrance
with the music.) He lay in a motionless heap. At a
few plaintive notes he lifts his head, then drops it
again. To the quick notes that follow he beats the
floor with his hands. As the music grows in volume,
his despair increases, and he leaps to his feet and
rushes wildly about the room, beating frantically
upon the walls. As the music changes and becomes
soft and reminiscent, Petrouchka thinks of the Ballerina
and stretches out his arms, then sorrowfully
drops his head. The motif for the Ballerina announces
her entrance. She comes in gay and light as a bird. Petrouchka,
overcome with emotion, drops on his knees
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>before her. She continues her gay little dance and
leaves as lightly as she entered. Despair again seizes
Petrouchka, who dashes himself against the walls,
then finally falls to the ground. The curtains close.</p>

<p class='c014'>In a gymnasium there are certain exercises that
bring all the muscles of the body into use. Likewise
there are times when the whole body of a marionette
must come into action. If you want a marionette to
climb a wall, your audience must feel that the marionette
is actually pulling himself, with effort, up and
over the wall. This requires a great deal of patient
practice. To make your marionette climb a wall, he
must first appear to catch hold of the wall, then to
draw up one knee, then to strain up as you would,
then to throw an arm over the wall, then to pull his
body up until he can throw a leg over the wall. If
this is well done, the audience climbs the walls with
the puppet.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sometimes, puppets must appear to assist each
other. For instance, when Myles was thrown on the
ground by the bully, Walter Blunt, Gascoigne, his
friend, got down on one knee beside him, threw his
arm around his shoulders, and apparently helped him
to rise.</p>

<p class='c014'>There are certain little tricks which are very effective,
such as crying, or dropping off to sleep and
snoring. In the <cite>Childhood of David Copperfield</cite>,
Mrs. Gummage frequently lifted her apron to her
eyes and wept. As one corner of her apron was sewed
to her hand, this was an easy thing to do. Can you
see her, shoulders shaking, her apron to her eyes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>sniffling, “I am a lone, lorn critter and everything
goes contrary with me?”</p>

<p class='c014'>In the illustration, page 130, you can see how a
puppet may appear to toss a ball. This is the way it
was done. One puppeteer held the Moor’s controller
while his assistant held the end of a string attached
to the ball. Through practice, these puppeteers were
able to make the Moor’s hand and the ball rise at the
same moment, thereby giving the impression that the
Moor tossed the ball. When the Moor stopped playing
with the ball, the puppeteer who held the string attached
to the ball let it fall to the stage. The audience
felt that the Moor was tired of playing and had tossed
the ball aside.</p>

<p class='c014'>In this same ballet, an organ grinder appeared. The
handle of the organ was fastened to one of his hands.
When the puppeteer pulled the hand string up and
down in time with the music, it seemed to the audience
that the organ was really being played. A
marionette can be made to play a flute. The flute is
fastened in one hand, and a string from the flute
passed through the mouth of the marionette up
through the top of its head to the controller. When
the puppeteer pulls the flute string, the flute is raised
to the mouth of the marionette.</p>

<p class='c014'>All these effects and many others can be accomplished
when you understand the manipulation of
your strings. Sometimes you may wish to use birds,
bees, butterflies, or flying dragons. If you keep the
wings in constant motion you can make your audience
believe that these winged creatures are really
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>flying. Of course, bees and butterflies move their
wings more rapidly than birds and dragons. The more
you observe flying birds, the better you will be able
to imitate them.</p>

<p class='c014'>You have made the puppet look the part, now see
that it acts the part. You have made your hero look
like a hero, now see that he acts like a hero. You
made the king look like a king. Can you make him
act like a king?</p>

<p class='c014'>The third step in your training as a puppeteer
comes when you have acquired enough skill to manage
your puppet. Then you are ready to join your
fellow puppeteers on the bridge. At first you will
probably feel that the bridge is not large enough for
you alone, not to mention four or five others. Experience
will show you, however, that you can do a great
deal in a very small space. This means good management
and practice and consideration for your fellow
puppeteers.</p>

<p class='c014'>Now that the puppet is on the stage, imagine what
a shock it would be to your audience to see a great
hand coming down below the proscenium arch. To
prevent this, always keep your hand, even during rehearsals,
close to your control.</p>

<p class='c014'>While on the stage, every motion must have a
reason behind it. Puppets cannot move aimlessly
about the stage any more than real actors can.
Every gesture, too, must mean something.</p>

<p class='c014'>Now the time has come to show yourselves as real
artists. Your stage is your picture and though you
change it with every move of your puppets, you are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>always making it the picture. This means that you
should know what artists speak of as arrangement or
composition.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_p130a.jpg' alt='[Stage]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Let us suppose that you are sitting in the audience
and saw two puppets standing like this: “Oh,
how stupid,” you would say. Imagine them standing
like this:</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_p130b.jpg' alt='[Stage]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_p130a2.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic005'>
<p><i>Upper: Marionettes from "The Adventures of Alice."</i><br>  <br>  <i>Lower Left: Bear and Trainer from "Men of Iron."</i><br>  <br>  <i>Lower Right: Marionette from "Petroushka."</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>“How interesting.” But why interesting? The first
spacing was equal, hence it was monotonous. The
second was varied, therefore, more interesting. Again
you are sitting in the audience looking at the picture
and this is what you see:</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_p131.jpg' alt='[Stage]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Two small figures on one side and one large figure on
the other side. How satisfying! The reason is balance.
You can see by these two simple illustrations how
necessary it is to keep in mind not only the movements
of your puppets, but the positions of all the
puppets on the stage. If each puppeteer understands
this and considers the relation of his puppet to every
other puppet, the audience will always see an interesting
picture.</p>

<p class='c014'>Equally as important as the stage picture is the conduct
of your puppets when on the stage. They should
all show interest when another puppet is speaking. This
may be done by turning the head to listen, nodding the
head to show agreement, shaking the head to show
disagreement, leaning forward to show interest. In a
hundred small ways a puppet can show life. The point
is, there should be no dead puppets on the stage.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>But there is a danger here. Puppets must not divert
the attention of the audience from the main character.
For example, in <cite>Men of Iron</cite> in the scene showing
the great hall of Devlin Castle, the minstrel is singing
before the king and his court. The jester, with his
pranks and capers, could easily have taken too much
of the attention of the audience to himself and away
from the minstrel, but instead, he sat down on the
floor near the minstrel and pretended to be playing a
lute. He followed every gesture of the minstrel and
when the minstrel finished his song, rose and bowed
low before the king. The jester did likewise, to the
amusement of the audience.</p>

<p class='c014'>Good puppeteering is much like good ball playing,
the interest is in the ball but the ball always moves.
It goes from player to player. Any player who holds
the ball is the center of interest, some longer and some
shorter. Your skill and cleverness can keep this sense
of movement and interest in your puppets and their
play. This smoothness is accomplished by your quickness
in watching for the last words spoken by the
speaker before you, which is called your cue; and also
by your cleverness in planning ways to help out a puppeteer
and his puppet who has difficult things to do.</p>

<p class='c014'>When the bear trainer, for example, commands his
bear to stand on his head, the boy who is holding the
bear’s controller must have time enough to make the
difficult manipulation of the strings. If the puppeteers
who manage the squires make their puppets lean
forward and call out in surprise to each other, “What?
A trick?” “The bear can do a trick.” “Look.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>“Bravo!” “Bravo!” (as the bear succeeds in standing
on its head), they will be of great assistance to the
bear puppeteer.</p>

<p class='c014'>Here is an illustration of the way in which you can
avoid awkward pauses. The Knave of Hearts, in the
play by that name, steals some tarts and climbs out
of the window. Now you can see that his puppeteer
would need plenty of time in getting the knave
through the window. Lady Violetta, who helps him
steal the tarts, shows great excitement and cries to
him to hurry, then she runs to the door, saying that
she hears someone coming. Then she runs back again.
She repeats this until the knave has made his escape.
You can easily imagine how this clever trick excited
the audience.</p>

<p class='c014'>Getting your puppet off the stage is just as important
as getting it on. Time your exits so that there
is no awkward pause between the last word spoken
and the exit.</p>

<p class='c014'>You have imagined yourself sitting in the audience
seeing a picture. Now can you imagine your disappointment
when you cannot understand a single
word the puppets say? Inexperienced puppeteers are
apt to think that it is the high, loud voice that will
reach the people in the last row of seats. Experienced
puppeteers know that it is the clear, full, rich voice
that carries. Address your words to those farthest
away from you. Keep in mind that your voice must
travel down and out through the proscenium arch.
If your head is not lowered, your voice will strike the
curtain, which will deaden it.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>Sometimes it is necessary to make the voice seem
to come from a distance and yet every word must be
distinct. This can be done in a very simple way.
Bend your arm and lift it to your face, holding your
mouth inside your elbow. Now when you speak, your
words seem to come from a distance. As you slowly
lift your mouth from your arm, your voice seems to
come nearer and nearer. In <cite>Sigurd, the Volsung</cite>,
there is a scene where the dragon, who possesses a
treasure of gold, comes, at twilight, out of the rocky
crevice of a great cliff, to drink at a pool. Before he is
seen, his voice is dimly heard calling, “Gold, gold, my
gold, my gold.” The boy who spoke these lines used
this trick so cleverly that his audience shivered as the
dragon appeared.</p>

<p class='c014'>Every person knows that the greatest charm of a
voice is its naturalness. This naturalness comes to you
when you let your feelings go down the strings into
your puppet. Then it is that your puppet comes to
life, is gay, sad, prankish, haughty, timid, bold, willful,
cunning, sly, or lovable. When your puppet obeys
your every feeling, you and your puppet are one.</p>

<h3 class='c002'><span class='c012'>CHAPTER X</span><br> Presenting Your Play</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>The successful presenting of a play requires much
planning and organization. It will be necessary to
choose a property man, two assistants, a stage electrician,
an inspector of the strings, one assistant, and
a prompter. It is the business of the property man to
see that the scenery and properties are in perfect
condition before each performance. He, with his assistant,
sets the stage long in advance of the performance.
He changes the settings for each act. It is necessary
for him to have two assistants, one for the right
and one for the left of the stage. The property man
finds places for all his properties. He places the properties
for each scene together. He places the back
drops and wings in the order in which they are to be
used. Each property, when not in use, should be in its
place. Benches should be provided behind the scenes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>for the puppeteers. If chairs are used, beware of
squeaky ones.</p>

<p class='c014'>The stage electrician is responsible for the lights
and the making of all changes in lighting between
acts. He must be provided with a chart of instructions,
giving the lighting plan for every scene. This plan
should be securely tacked where it can be easily referred
to. The electrician can also take care of the
drawing of the curtains, which is an important task.
There should also be a sheet of cues for the drawing
of the curtains, since a scene can be spoiled by drawing
the curtains too soon, too quickly, too slowly, or
too jerkily. The last words spoken in the first scene
of <cite>Men of Iron</cite> were: “I will climb the wall and fetch
it.” This was the signal or cue for the electrician to
close the curtains.</p>

<p class='c014'>The prompter ought to have a low, clear voice and
ought to be a person in whom every puppeteer has
confidence. Girls usually make good prompters because
of the quality of their voices. The prompter
should stand on the bridge near the middle and always
keep her eyes on the lines. She should never fail
to prompt a puppeteer the instant he needs it. She
never confuses the puppeteers by trying to prompt
them when they do not need it. She must know the
play so well that she understands every pause.</p>

<p class='c014'>The inspector of the strings is another important
person in the organization. This office is usually well
filled by a girl. If there are a great many puppets she
may need an assistant. It is her duty to test all the
strings about a half hour before the play. This is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>done by placing the thumb and forefinger on the
string, just under the controller, then letting the string
pass between the thumb and forefinger as they travel
down to the marionette. If there is a weak part in the
string it can be easily detected. She sees that the
fastening at the controller is secure, and that the
strings hang straight and untangled from the controller
to the marionette. She should provide a first-aid
box fully equipped with scissors, thread, paper of
pins, thumb tacks, and needles. A threaded needle,
with the thread the length of the knee strings, can be
pinned into the curtain so that it is available the
second it is needed. A place for everything, and everything
in its place, does much toward making your performance
move along with smoothness and rapidity.
All puppeteers, including property man, electrician,
and prompter should wear gymnasium shoes. In fact,
anyone who assists behind the scenes should do the
same. If you find that your bridge stairs creak the
puppeteers should remain on the bridge throughout
the scene. Before a puppeteer comes down from the
bridge, he hangs up his marionette.</p>

<p class='c014'>Since silence is so necessary behind the scenes, it
can readily be understood how important it is to have
absolutely no talking on the bridge, or between puppeteers
who are waiting behind the stage. Scenes must
be changed and properties moved almost noiselessly.
If you have a high ideal of perfection for your play,
two or three weeks of daily rehearsals will be necessary.
This is especially true for any marionette ballet,
such as Petrouchka, where it is necessary to memorize
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>the music, because each puppeteer is dependent on
the music for his cues. Before the curtains open all
marionettes that are to be in the scene should be in
their places on the stage. Hold your controller with a
steady hand, so that your marionette is motionless.
Keep your puppet on its feet. Do not let it sag. Remember
the sagging puppet.</p>

<p class='c014'>As soon as the curtains open, begin your lines. Remember
that a play is like a piece of music, it moves
onward in perfect time. An awkward pause, or hesitation,
breaks the time and destroys the spell you are
weaving about your audience. Entrances and exits
should be so arranged that the marionette makes his
entrance and begins to speak his lines as soon as the
speaker before him finishes his lines. We have spoken
of the spell that you are trying to weave. Let us see
what has been done, so far, toward this end. The puppets
are beautifully made. The scenery is lovely in
design and color. Hands, through patient practice,
have acquired that deftness and sureness that we call
skill. The voices are well pitched and appropriate for
each character.</p>

<p class='c014'>The greatest thing, however, is yet to be done. It
is to touch the imagination of your audience. The key
to this world of the imagination is suggestion. The
lights and setting give the mood. The voices and the
movements of the puppets convey the thoughts and
emotions of the characters of the play. The harmony
of lights, setting, voices, and the movements of the
puppets work the spell.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the battle scene in <cite>Sigurd, the Volsung</cite>, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>curtains open on a stage where a low mound and one
tree is silhouetted against a twilight sky. A bit of
afterglow still lingers. On the ground are several
shields and spears and two prostrate figures. Against
one of the figures lies Sigmund, the great Norse hero.
Beside him kneels his faithful wife, Hiordis. The audience
feels that, shrouded in the mysterious blue light,
are a great host of noble slain. Sigmund bids Hiordis
gather up the pieces of his broken sword to keep for
his son that is to be born. Out of the shadows, dimly
seen in his “gleaming gray mantle and cloud-blue
hood,” comes Odin, to welcome Sigmund to the hall
of the heroes in Walhalla. Hiordis bows her head in
silence and the audience experiences her grief, and
shares her hope for the future. The afterglow in the
sky seems to be a promise of a new day.</p>

<h3 class='c002'><span class='c012'>CHAPTER I</span><br> The Map of the Mask</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>From the map it is evident that masks have been
worn in every part of the world. They are older than
the idols which primitive man made for himself. Why
he invented masks we do not exactly know. They
may have originated when man first attempted to
impersonate the gods as he sought to control nature.
If you can imagine how vast and mysterious the
world of nature looked to primitive man and how he
felt about all moving things, animals, clouds, winds,
flowing water, swaying trees, and creeping vines, you
can understand how he came to believe that there
were spirits dwelling in such things and that these
indwelling spirits had power to work him good or evil.
Through offerings and prayers he sought to control
these mysterious spirits and make them do his will.</p>

<p class='c014'>Death was the greatest of all mysteries. Where did
the spirit go when it left the body? It must go somewhere.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>Why not into an animal, or a tree, or even into
a stone? Gradually this came to be his belief. His
desire for mastery and power over the spirits led
him to imagine faces more powerful and compelling
than his own which would dominate them. He was
full of invention. He invented the mask and became a
god. When he wore the mask he believed that he controlled
indwelling spirits and even coming events.
This belief was true of primitive man the world over.</p>

<p class='c014'>In Africa, masks were always worn in the tribal
religious rites. When a dancer wore a mask, he was
no longer an individual for he felt within himself the
spirit of all his tribe. When the dance was finished,
the mask was taken from the head and worshiped
like an idol. These masks were created by the greatest
artists of the tribe. They were simple, strong, and
severe, without naturalism of any kind. They exaggerated
the character of eyes, nose, and mouth in
order to give intensity of expression. They were
strange, but not terrifying. They were an effort to
reveal the inner relations of man, nature, and God.
They were beautifully made out of wood, copper,
bronze, and ivory.</p>

<p class='c014'>Quite different masks are found among the primitive
people of North America. The Eskimos in Alaska
make animal masks such as of the bear, wolf, beaver,
and various birds to represent their totem ancestors.
Every totemistic tribe has its own animal ancestor
which it believes is impressed upon everything around
the dwelling. The Eskimos believe that in the early
days, if animals wished to assume human form, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>could do so at will by pushing up their faces or beaks,
as if they were masks. This human or man-like form
they called the “inua.” It was supposed to represent
the thinking part of the animal, and, at its death,
became its shade or ghost. During the many festivals
when the Eskimos wore their animal masks, they believed
that they actually became the creature that they
represented. Some of their masks were ingeniously
made with double faces, so arranged that, at certain
times in the ceremony, the outer mask which was held
in place by pegs could be removed, thus symbolizing
the transformation of the animal into the man.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Indians of California observe annual ceremonies
of mourning for the dead. Ten or more men prepare
themselves to play the part of the ghosts. Disguised
with painted masks, and adorned with feathers
and grasses, they dance and sing in the village or rush
about at night in the forest, with burning torches in
their hands. The relatives of the dead look upon the
maskers as their departed friends.</p>

<p class='c014'>Other Indian tribes disguise themselves by painting
their faces instead of wearing masks. The inspiration
for the painting comes from a trance or a vision. The
dancer makes his request to the leader of the ceremony.
“My Father, I have come to be painted, so
that I may see my friends. Have pity on me and paint
me.” Elaborate designs in red, yellow, green, and
blue are put upon the face, with a red or yellow line
upon the parting of the hair. The designs most commonly
used are sun, moon, stars, crosses, and birds.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Indians of Arizona and New Mexico, such as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>the Hopi and Zuni, are ancestor worshipers. They
believe that their dead relatives become supernatural
spirits or “cachinas” or “kokos.” They consider them
guardians that they may call upon in time of distress
and need. If the crops have suffered from drought,
they bring out the sacred masks and perform the rain
dance.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Zuni believe that the earth is watered by these
departed ancestors, who as they pass to and fro
continuously over the middle plains collect water in
vases and gourd jugs from the six great waters of the
world. They are unseen by the people below, because
they wear cloud masks.</p>

<p class='c014'>The masks worn by the Zuni dancers in their great
winter festivals bear symbols characteristic of the
cachinas and are repainted with great care before
each dance. Many and varied are the names of the
different masks, such as Mountain Goat-hunter Mask,
Thrush Mask, Owl Mask, Buffalo Mask, Dust-in-the-House
Woman Mask, Rain-Drop-Maker Mask, Long-Life-Maker
Mask.</p>

<p class='c014'>The ancient Aztecs wore masks decorated with turquoise
and shell.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>In Brazil, masks were used in dances performed in
honor of the dead. The mask represented animals,
birds, and insects. They obtained their magical power
by the wearer imitating the movements and actions
of these creatures. For instance, the butterfly masks
came by their magic through the dance of two men
who imitated the play of these brilliant insects fluttering
on the wing, settling on sand banks and rocks.
The magic of the swallow masks came through the
imitation of the swallow, and so it was with the owl,
spider, vulture, beetle, toad, jaguar mask, and others.
After the dance the masks were burned in order to
drive the indwelling spirits back to their haunts.
Even idols needed masks to give them life, and special
power over disease and disaster. These masks must
be as enduring as the gods themselves, so they were
made of terra cotta, shell, and stone. Among the gifts
made to Columbus when he landed in San Salvador
were some of these sacred masks.</p>

<p class='c014'>Masks originated in Asia just as they did in Africa
and America, through man’s fears and superstitions.
In India, China, Japan, and throughout the Orient,
they have been used for centuries in religious ceremonies.
Gradually they were introduced into court
functions, such as wedding and birthday celebrations,
and finally animal masks were used to entertain the
common people.</p>

<p class='c014'>The highly involved religions of these eastern
peoples, with their countless deities, brought infinite
variety to their masks. Their civilization, being old
and rich in tradition, gave to the mask subtleties and
refinement of characterization that could not be conceived
of by primitive peoples. Their masks reflected
their clear, well-defined ideas, and showed their artists’
amazing ability to recognize and analyze expressions
of the human face. Tranquillity, mirth, cunning,
scorn, wrath, and subtle shades of feeling are portrayed.
The idea in the mind of the mask maker was
so clear that we are never left in doubt as to the meaning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>of the mask. They are emotional interpretations,
never realistic portraits.</p>

<p class='c014'>Chinese priests used the mask in morality plays
showing the rewards and punishments that will be
meted out in their many heavens, hells, and purgatories.
Their masks are usually horrible or terrifying,
sometimes humorous, rarely beautiful. They are worn
by gorgeously costumed priests who enact the plays, in
pantomime, on stages erected in the temple courtyards.</p>

<p class='c014'>In Siam, Burma, Java, and Ceylon, the mask
passed from the temple to the theater and the strolling
players. Much of its old symbolism has been lost,
and it frequently becomes merely an elaborate piece
of decoration.</p>

<p class='c014'>Probably the most beautiful masks in the world
are the religious or <i>No</i> masks of Japan. These are
worn in the sacred <i>No</i> plays, of which there are more
than two hundred. They represent the Japanese idea
of the appearance of their gods and heroes. Music,
dance, and dialogue all are used in the five or six
short plays which make the <i>No</i> cycle. The <i>No</i> begins
with the bestowing of blessings by the gods and their
victory over the demons. A short love story follows,
with possibly a bit of humor, and then a picture of the
passing of life. The end is a gracious recognition of
the favor of the gods. These ancient plays are performed
out of doors on a simple platform erected
against a wall on which is painted a symbolic pine
tree. Masks have been used for more than four hundred
years in these <i>No</i> dramas.</p>

<p class='c014'>The ancient Egyptians used the mask in their sacrificial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>ceremonies. In the “Book of the Dead” ceremony
one may see a priest wearing the jackal-headed
mask of Anubis, standing before the bier of the great
god, Osiris. The victims kneeling before him wear
hare and hawk headed masks. Egyptian kings wore
lion, bull, and dragon masks to impress their subjects
with their mighty power. Even the mummies wore
masks. On the faces of their dead kings they placed
masks of pure gold as did the Mycenæans.</p>

<p class='c014'>The mask, as we know it, came to us through the
Greeks. In the worship of Demeter, the earth mother
of the Greeks, masks of horses, pigs, cats, hares, and
asses were used. Masks were also used in the worship
of Dionysus, with dancing, chanting, and chorus. The
Greeks, being the first people to have a theater, were
also the first people to realize that no human face
could portray the sustained expression of tragedy and
comedy called for by the great rôles of their dramas.
The mask became a necessity. Thespis is credited
with its invention. The mask enabled an actor to
play female rôles, to play many different characters,
and to represent his character in youth, middle life,
and old age. The open mouth characterized the Greek
mask. Some scholars have believed that a brass
mouthpiece was used to amplify the voice of the actor.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Romans appropriated the Greek mask. Virgil
tells us that they hung masks on trees at the time of
sowing, in order to better the crops. Noble Romans
wore masks of their illustrious ancestors at funerals.
The impersonators riding in chariots through the
streets were dressed in rich robes of office, resplendent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>in purple and gold such as the dead nobles had worn
in their lifetime. When the funeral procession reached
the Forum, the maskers solemnly took their seats on
the ivory chairs placed for them on the platform of
the rostra, in the sight of all the people. This spectacle,
no doubt, stirred memories of the glorious past in
the hearts of the old and fired the young with noble
ambitions. It is said that Nero wore masks resembling
his own face and those of his favorites.</p>

<p class='c014'>With the passing of glorious Rome the mask became
a degraded thing, abhorred by the early Christians.</p>

<p class='c014'>Throughout the Dark Ages in Europe the mask was
used only in the revels, and to celebrate the coming
of the New Year and the springtime. Gradually the
spirit of revelling slipped into the Church. In England
and in France, during the XIIth Century, there was
a very famous revel called “The Feast of Fools” that
began at vespers on the last day of the year. Two
equally famous revels were those of the “Boy Bishop”
and the “Feast of the Ass,” celebrated with rout and
mock ritual. Such were the excesses indulged in that
Pope Innocent III, in 1207 <span class='fss'>A. D.</span>, formally prohibited
masking in the church. But it was not until the XVth
Century that these revels were effectively driven out.
We hear next of the mask in scriptural plays, such as
those given at Christmas time. These plays were performed
outside the church. During the XIVth Century,
we discover the guilds or corporations of craftsmen
employing the mask in their religious plays, in
honor of royal visits, and in their May Day processions.
In fact, all over Europe, at that time wherever
the mystery, miracle, or morality play was given,
we are sure to find at least occasional use of the mask.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>In Italy, from the XIVth to the XVIIth Century,
the mask was worn by Harlequin, Pantaloon, Pulcinella,
the Doctor, and all the characters of the
<cite>Commedia dell’arte</cite>. In the XVIIIth Century, the
comedy theaters of France also affected the mask
as a dramatic requisite.</p>

<p class='c014'>During the XIXth Century the mask had degenerated
to the crude false faces used by Europeans
or their descendants in America. In Philadelphia,
children wear masks at Thanksgiving. Masks appear
at the celebration of the Mardi Gras in New Orleans,
and the old-time custom of wearing masks at Hallowe’en
still prevails.</p>

<p class='c014'>A few years ago a group of artists, foremost among
them W. T. Benda, who knew the great and beautiful
tradition of the mask and had felt its strange fascination,
lifted the mask to a new level of distinction.
Anyone who has had the good fortune to see one of
their masks cannot escape its spell nor can he rest
until he finds an occasion to make a mask.</p>

<h3 class='c002'><span class='c012'>CHAPTER II</span><br> Occasions for Wearing the Mask</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>We all know the thrill of wearing a mask, but an
entirely new and strange thrill awaits him who wears
a mask of his own creation. Anyone who has imagination
is apt to turn away from the ordinary commercial
mask, because his fancy can picture something much
more clever and interesting.</p>

<p class='c014'>When one looks at the calendar he is surprised to
find that there are so many days that invite the wearing
of masks. The first occasion for wearing a mask
that comes to mind is Hallowe’en, that old celebration
of the eve of All Saints’ Day. The religious significance
of this festival is almost forgotten, but it still
marks the fullness of the harvest time and has long
been celebrated with masks and merry-making. Even
the glowing jack-o’-lantern is a kind of mask.</p>

<p class='c014'>For occasions such as the New Year and April
Fools’ Day the mask may express an individual idea
or fancy. There are a few days, however, such as
Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Easter, for which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>masks must be specially designed. These masks should
represent the characters that one associates with the
occasions. When a story is woven about these characters
and then told in pantomime, by actors wearing
masks, it may be called a mask. Music and dance add
much to the beauty of a mask.</p>

<p class='c014'>Woodland, park, and garden are ideal settings for
masks in spring, summer, and autumn. Arbor Day,
Shakespeare’s birthday, and May Day are delightful
occasions which stir the imagination and have rich
associations in music and literature.</p>

<p class='c014'>Let us suppose that one wishes to celebrate Christmas
with a mask. Christmas is a Christian festival
but it is being celebrated more and more by all people
who believe in brotherly love and good will. These
attributes can become the theme of the mask. The
possibilities for developing this theme of brotherly
love and good will are endless. The story may be laid
in any land. It may center about the life of a great
court or about the humblest home. But wherever it is
laid, the story must have dramatic interest and touch
the feelings of those who see it.</p>

<p class='c014'>A simple mask may be just as beautiful and moving
as a very elaborate mask. Whether it is to be one or
the other will depend largely upon the size of the
group that wishes to present it, and the place where it
is to be given.</p>

<p class='c014'>Since the mask grew out of the Church, and since
the Church provides a beautiful and dignified setting,
naturally it becomes a most appropriate place for a
Christmas mask. The Church has so much to offer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>that it is not surprising to find it again welcoming
pageantry and the mask. The organist and choir provide
the music, members with dramatic talent perform
the pantomime, sewing groups make the costumes,
while those who have a gift for crafts can make
the masks and properties.</p>

<p class='c014'>A Christmas mask, when given in a school, may
require the coöperation of all departments. The English
department may find the theme and place it in a
period and give it dramatic form and train the reader
and maskers in pantomime. In the art department,
the masks will be made, the costumes and properties
will be designed and decorated. The library furnishes
books and plates. The sewing department makes the
costumes. The wood-working department makes the
properties. The music department finds appropriate
music and trains the chorus. The printing department
prints programs, posters, and tickets.</p>

<p class='c014'>Here is an example of the plan and development of
a Christmas mask given for children by the pupils of
a junior high school. The first consideration was the
size of the stage and its possibilities. The second consideration
was the attention of the audience. It was
thought that an entertainment that lasted an hour
would not be too long. The problem then was to find
or to make a story that would develop, reach its climax
and conclusion within an hour. Naturally this
story had to be dramatic, have a simple and clearly
defined plot, and its characters few and vivid. The
story chosen was laid in England in the XVth Century.
The history, art, songs, and customs of that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>time seemed to lend themselves so readily to a
mask. The theme chosen was unselfish love. The
characters were the King, Queen, Sage, Lady-in-Waiting,
Pages, Peasant Mother, and her son, St.
George, the Dragon, the Doctor and Jack, the Giant
Killer, and the Morris dancers. Beautiful old English
carols were woven into the story, which was told by a
reader, accompanied by a harp. The mask begins with
the carol “Holy Night, Silent Night.” This is sung
by a concealed chorus of boys. The curtains open, the
King is seated on his throne, his Counsellor and Page
beside him. The reader begins a story of selfishness
and greed that rule throughout the kingdom and
with a dream of the unhappy King. The Sage opens
his great book and counsels the King to send forth
messengers to find if anyone in all the land has done
an unselfish deed. This alone can save the kingdom.
The scene closes with the departure of the
pages and the singing of the carol: “We three Kings
of the Orient are, bearing gifts, we have traveled
afar.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The second scene is laid in a humble dwelling. Here
an old peasant mother awaits the return of her son
from his day’s work. The reader tells the story of
their poverty, and of the old mother’s courage in
facing the day when her son must leave her to go
forth into the world. Distant carolers are heard
singing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Good King Wenceslaus looked out on the feast of Stephen.</div>
      <div class='line'>While the snow lay round about deep and crisp and even.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>As the carolers’ voices die away, the son returns and
tells a marvelous tale. He has saved the son of a nobleman
from a wild boar and as a reward the nobleman
offers to take him away to his great castle. The
mother rejoices in his good fortune, though it means
their separation. The son tells his mother that he has
refused the reward in order to stay and take care of her.</p>

<p class='c014'>They sit down to their humble meal, and bow their
heads in thanksgiving. One of the King’s messengers
enters, tells of his futile quest and asks them if they
have heard of anyone who has performed an unselfish
deed. The mother tells of her son’s devotion. The
messenger rejoices and declares that in all his wanderings
he has heard of nothing but selfishness. He bids
them follow him to the court. As the curtains close,
the chorus sings: “Joy to the World.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The third scene shows the King and Queen upon
the throne, a Lady-in-Waiting and the Counsellor
attending them. The unsuccessful messengers return,
kneel before the throne, and sadly bow their heads.
The triumphant messenger returns, bringing with him
the old mother and her son. The reader tells the story
of their devotion and there is general rejoicing. The
King bestows blessings and favors and then sends for
the mummers, who come in led by St. George and the
Doctor with his great bottles of pills (“red to cure,
and blue to kill”) little Jack, the Giant Killer, the
terrible Dragon, and the Morris dancers.</p>

<p class='c014'>The mummers perform the old English play of St.
George and the Dragon. The Morris men give the
stick dance. At the close St. George and little Jack
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>beg pennies from the court, while the dancers go
begging through the audience and the chorus sings:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Here we come a wassailing among the leaves so green.</div>
      <div class='line'>Here we come a wandering so fair to be seen.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The King steps forth and blesses all the people.
They kneel reverently as the Christmas chimes begin
to ring. The King and Queen now come down and
kneel with their people, while the chorus triumphantly
sings: “Hark, the Herald Angels Sing, Glory to
the New-born King.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The Christmas mask illustrated in these pages was
written about the Crusade of St. Louis of France. It
sought to re-create, through music, pantomime, costumes,
and dance, the spirit of the XVth Century.
It was inspired by the wealth of the material of this
period in the Cleveland Museum of Art. Here were
examples of Gothic sculpture which gave the note of
simplicity and reverence, and at the same time accurate
information about pose, expression, costume, and
line. The stained-glass windows, enamels, and illuminated
manuscripts gave suggestions for color and
color arrangement. Old Italian chests and the frames
of early Siennese paintings influenced the designs of
the necessary furniture. In the art library were found
photographs and plates of sculptures of the cathedrals
of Chartres, Amiens, and Rheims. These were
studied for costumes, headdresses, ornaments, and
especially for the types of faces which were to be used
in the masks. Examples of early textiles were drawn
upon for designs of costumes and background.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>The King collection of books on costume at the
Cleveland Historical Society furnished references on
costumes.</p>

<p class='c014'>The rare John G. White collection of folklore and
music in the Cleveland Public Library furnished
songs and chronicles of the time. In this collection
beautiful old French music of the XIth, XIIth, and
XIIIth centuries was found. The songs were translated
and adapted so that they could be sung by
children. The action of the mask was made to take
place on Christmas Eve, in the year 1255, in the hall
of the castle of Count Mathew of Brittany. The
mask began with a procession of forty children, in
costume, singing this XIVth Century noel:</p>

<h3 class='c002'><span class='c012'>CHAPTER III</span><br> Making the Mask</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>Anyone who has ever tried to make masks,
knows their fascination. A pillowcase with two holes
cut in it for eyes may have been your first mask.
A paper bag may have been your second mask. What
a wonderful chance this gave you to show your originality.
You may remember how you labored to express
some humorous or grotesque idea. There was the
paper nose that you cut, fitted and glued to it, and
the ears that you made for it, the mouth that you
painted, and the headdress of feathers and quills.
Above all, there was the joy of wearing it and of
comparing your mask with the masks of your friends.</p>

<p class='c014'>All masks reflect the ideas and feelings of those who
make them. Great masks have individuality and
character. How does one make a mask that has character?
It is done in some such manner as this: First
decide whether your mask is to represent an imaginary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>character or a historical character. If it is to represent
an imaginary character you will have a great
deal of freedom in working out your idea, for no one
can say, exactly, what a goblin or demon or any
fanciful creature looks like. But if your mask is to
represent a historical character the problem is quite
a different one. In that case you are guided by tradition
and also by the structure and proportions of the
human face.</p>

<p class='c014'>Let us suppose that you wish to make a mask of a
noble king. He probably would have a high forehead,
a straight brow, a strong, firm chin, and a kindly
mouth. Exaggerate the high forehead, the straight
brow, the firm chin, and the kindliness of the mouth,
and you will find that every one who sees your mask
will be conscious of its nobility. Is your king young
or old? If he is old, there will be hollows about his
eyes, nose, and mouth, and his cheeks may be thin.
If he is young, his flesh will be firm and there will be
no drawn or sagging muscles. Exaggerate the roundness
of youth and the thinness of old age, keeping the
proportions and qualities which indicate nobility.</p>

<p class='c014'>The brow indicates mood—surprise and curiosity
are shown by arched eyebrows; sadness and grief are
shown by drooping eyebrows; perplexity and anger
are shown by the drawing together of the eyebrows.</p>

<p class='c014'>The nose is very important and demands careful
study. It should be consistent with the character.
Can you imagine a noble, generous king with a short,
upturned nose?</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>The mouth and chin are quite as important as the
brow and nose. Beginners often have great difficulty
in modeling them, because they forget to consider the
profile. The lips and chin must be built out and
shaped exactly like those of the human face.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_p162.jpg' alt='[Mask]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c014'>When you have the character of this noble king
well in mind, take a pencil and paper and make a
sketch of him, front view and side view. Keep in mind
the general proportions of his face. Having made
your drawing you are ready to begin your work with
clay. Measure your face from chin to the crown of
the head, and the width of your face from ear to ear.
Do this carefully, for a good mask should fit the face
of the wearer. Onto a slate or a board crush some
newspapers into a mound, about 4 by 6 inches, and
3 inches high. This paper, acting as a core, will
save your clay and insure its quick drying. Pack the
clay over the paper as in the illustration, to a depth
of about 6 inches. If the length of your face is 8½
inches, make the mound of clay 8¾ inches, since the
clay shrinks in drying. For the same reason, add an
extra ¼ inch to the width. With your drawing before
you, begin modeling the clay. Remember that a face
is not flat. Observe the plans of the forehead, the
cheeks, and eye sockets. The expression which you
imagine the noble king to have had should be modeled
into the clay and the wrinkles cut into the forehead
and about the mouth. You must study your mask
from many angles in order to make it lifelike.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_p162a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic003'>
<p><i>Characters from Christmas Mask</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>If you do not finish your modeling the first day,
cover the clay with wet cloths to keep it from hardening.
When you have completed your clay model it
will require twenty-four to thirty-six hours for it to
dry. From this model you are now ready to make
either a papier-mâché mask or a buckram mask. If
you wish to make a papier-mâché mask cover the
model when thoroughly dry with a thin coat of
vaseline. Now tear medium-weight wrapping paper,
cream and brown for instance, into pieces three
or four inches long, soak them in hot water, wring
out separately, dip into flour paste, and rub gently
between the fingers until they feel like wet chamois
skin. Cover the entire surface with the cream-colored
strips of paper. The pieces may overlap but there
must be no wrinkles. When the entire surface is
covered you may apply immediately a second layer.
Let this be of the brown paper. Follow this with
a third layer of cream and a fourth layer of
brown. If your paper is thin, apply a fifth or even
a sixth layer to give the necessary thickness and
strength. The alternating of the cream and brown
will help you to count your layers and insures uniform
thickness. Strive to keep a smooth surface and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>uniform thickness. Do not forget that in this process
the last layer of paper becomes the outer surface of
your mask. After twenty-four or thirty-six hours, the
paper masks should be dry enough to remove from
the clay. Plasticine may be used instead of clay but
since it does not harden, this process necessitates
making a plaster of Paris mold. The directions for
making this are given on page 66.</p>

<p class='c014'>When you have removed the paper mask from the
clay or plaster mold, cut out the eye and nostril holes.
If a mask is to be worn by a dancer, the lips should
be modeled slightly opened to permit the cutting
away of the paper between the lips.</p>

<p class='c014'>If you decide to make a buckram mask you will
require a piece of light-colored buckram about twice
the size of the face. Soften the buckram with warm
water, then place over the clay model which has been
covered with a coat of soapsuds. Press the buckram
carefully, so as to bring out all the modeling of the
features, then allow to dry.</p>

<p class='c014'>The next step is the construction of that part of the
mask which will cover the head. Here you will need
assistance. While you hold the mask to your face,
your assistant will take a one-inch strip of heavy
paper, long enough to go around the back of the head,
and attach it to the outside edges of the mask, just
above the ears. If this strip is attached too low, the
mask cannot be removed from the head, if too high,
the mask will not be held securely. You will soon discover
that it is necessary to put the chin into the
mask first, when you put it on. A mask should fit the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>face and head closely. If you follow the steps in the
illustration, you will see how this basketlike framework
is constructed and how any kind of headdress
can be built up on it. When a headdress is completed,
and the inside of the mask is finished with a lining of
papier-mâché, you are ready to paint the mask. Oil
paints are the most practical. Tempera colors, however,
may be used. The painting of the mask should
emphasize the character.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_p165.jpg' alt='[Masks]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Complexion is the first consideration. Faces usually
are fair, sallow, or swarthy. There are certain masks,
however, that are much more effective when they are
painted symbolically. The mask of the priest of Osiris
was painted a rich green to indicate the fertility of
the Nile. The demon mask was painted a greenish-gray.
Yellow, vermilion, and black were used to
heighten the terrifying aspects. Observation and experiment
will guide you in the painting of the eyes,
lips, brow, and hair, and also in the subtle violet
shadows about the eyes, cheeks, and chin. Beware of
timid lines that imitate nature. They say very little
when the mask is a few feet away from you. Big,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>sweeping rhythmic lines make for design and carrying
power, and are to be seen in all great masks. The inside
of the mask should also be painted, decorated
if you like, and shellacked when the oil paint is thoroughly
dry. This prevents the breath from softening
the papier-mâché. The outside must not be shellacked.</p>

<p class='c014'>The masks shown in the accompanying illustrations
aimed to bring out the most important traits of the
character chosen. North American Indian symbolism
of design and color was carried out in the masks of the
Corn Maidens. Each mask was made by a different
person, with a very clear idea in mind of what she
wished her mask to express. Notice how like and yet
unlike these Corn Maiden masks are. A clown’s face is
supposed to show grotesque humor. By exaggerating
nose, ears, and mouth, both in shape and color, the
grotesque effects of the clown group were produced.
Cheerfulness and contented old age are characterized
by two Oriental masks shown at the bottom of the
page. The demon mask grew out of a careful study of
Chinese and Japanese demon masks.</p>

<p class='c014'>The remoteness and dignity of ancient Egypt are
reflected in the mask of the Priest of Osiris. The poetical
sensitiveness of the mask of an Oriental poet was
inspired by the faces in early Persian miniatures.
There is much of wistfulness and subtle character delineation
in the mask of the jester. This mask was
worn with a parti-colored costume, cap and bells.</p>

<p class='c014'>The possibilities of character masks are suggested
by the photographs of the “Christmas Masque” given
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>by the children’s singing classes of the Cleveland
Museum of Art, and by the ninth grade special art
class of Fairmount Junior High School, assisted by
the Music School Settlement at the Cleveland Museum
of Art, Christmas, 1925.</p>

<h3 class='c002'><span class='c012'>CHAPTER IV</span><br> The Costume and Setting for the Mask</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>Costume is a means of introducing characters,
of telling time and place, and of creating dramatic
mood. A costume should be different from ordinary
clothes, and should have a characteristic quality that
will help an actor to interpret his part. Imagine
Charlie Chaplin in any other outfit than his own. Do
you think this costume of his came by chance? Much
thought and experiment went into its creation. Have
you ever noticed how this artist wears his shabby,
droll, almost pathetic costume, and how he uses it
to play upon your feelings? His work is an illustrious
example of a great artist’s use of costume.</p>

<p class='c014'>There are two kinds of costumes, those which grow
out of pure imagination and those which reproduce
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>the costumes worn in different periods in different
countries. The latter are spoken of as period costumes.
Under imaginative costumes come those of Maeterlinek’s
<cite>Blue Bird</cite> which represent fire, water, milk,
sugar, bread, and those of the old morality plays, such
as virtue, vice, modesty, poverty, envy, and greed.</p>

<p class='c020'><i>Imaginative Costumes.</i> Three things are essential to
the imaginative costume: appropriate line, appropriate
color, and appropriate material. The kind of
costume that would represent wind would require
drapery, the lines of which would suggest the movement
of wind when the body was in motion. Water,
however, would require straight, downward falling
lines. The color of an imaginative costume is important.
Who can imagine a fairy in black or a gnome in
white, a character representing spring in russet brown
or one representing autumn in yellow-green? Materials
likewise have their appropriate uses. Fairies
are not weighted down with velvet, neither are
gnomes given costumes of gauze.</p>

<p class='c020'><i>Period Costumes.</i> When we come to period costumes,
accurate information is necessary. The quest
leads us to libraries, with their illustrated books, photographs,
and plates; to historical and art museums
with whatever they may have of original material.</p>

<p class='c020'><cite>North American Indian Costumes.</cite> One costume
that is familiar to every American boy and girl is that
of the North American Indian. We occasionally see
Indians at the circus, as traveling medicine men, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>on their reservations. Many museums are making
collections of their costumes and their arts. Government
publications, such as the beautifully illustrated
ethnological reports, with information about almost
every tribe, are in most libraries. Many libraries have
the wonderful Curtis photographs. The <cite>National
Geographic</cite> and other magazines have illustrations
that could also be used.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>Considering the dramatic part that the Indian has
played in American life, what subject could be more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>appropriate for a mask? Indian life and legend offer
an equally vivid and colorful opportunity for the
mask. The wealth of material is inspiring. Every
community in our country can find somewhere in its
history stirring events related to Indian life. What
could be more interesting than to weave these incidents
of pioneer life into masks? These could be presented
by school clubs and boy and girl scout troops,
in parks and playgrounds.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c020'><cite>Bible Costumes.</cite> A mask with characters taken from
the Bible could be very beautifully costumed. One
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>could use pictures of the artist, Tissot, who spent
many years of his life in Palestine, sketching costumes
that he felt were similar to those of Bible times. His
illustrations show how widely the rich Eastern costumes
differ from our own. The materials used were
fine, transparent linen and silk and cloth made from
wool and camels’ and goats’ hair. The various classes
of people were distinguished by difference in the richness,
costliness, and simplicity of their dress. Ornament
is very characteristic of all these Oriental costumes.
The sculptured figures on one of the tombs
near Thebes show the Israelites brought before
their Egyptian conquerors wearing fringed garments.
Moses commanded that fringe be worn by his people.
This was probably a survival of a still more ancient
usage in the family of Jacob. Assyrian reliefs
show Israelite captives being stripped of their ornaments,
sandals, anklets, embroidered robes and
tunics, girdles and armlets, thin veils, caps of network,
ear pendants, bracelets, rings, and jewels of
the nose.</p>

<p class='c020'><i>Egyptian Costumes.</i> The costumes of the ancient
Egyptians may easily come into a mask of Bible
times. Materials used were fine linen, cotton, and
wool. The common people wore merely a piece of
linen tied around the loins. Occasionally the skin of a
tiger or leopard was thrown over the shoulders. Both
men and women wore broad collars around the neck
and over the breast. The men wore armlets, bracelets,
and finger rings, while the women added to these ornaments,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>diadems, girdles, and bands of ornament
around the breast and hips. The headdress was important,
for it indicated the rank of the wearer. The
illustration shows the characteristic features of their
costumes.</p>

<p class='c020'><i>Cretan Costumes.</i> If you have ever felt that the
ancient costume lacked what we call “style,” behold
this snappy, chic little Cretan goddess! With her
short-sleeved, closely fitting jacket, full flounced skirt
and wasp waist, headgear, loops, and sashes. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>might have been the very latest word from Paris a
generation ago.</p>

<p class='c020'><i>Greek Costumes.</i> When we speak of Greek costumes,
we usually think of those upon Greek statues, such as
the Athena and Artemis. Since these are in marble
or in plaster of Paris, it is quite natural that we should
think of the Greek costume as being white. It is interesting
to learn, however, that Greek costumes
showed a great variety of colors.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='ic003'>
<p><i>Greek Costumes: Man and Woman</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The favorite colors were deep purple, red, and
yellow. There was a very dark blue and a green described
as the color of unripe grapes or frog colored.
The materials used, were linen, wool, sometimes cotton,
and silk. The costumes worn by the common
people were of coarsely woven wool. The finest weaving
was worn by the people of wealth. Design was
important in the Greek costume. Sometimes it was
an all over symmetrical pattern or a floral or an animal
pattern. Even the human figure was used as a
motif. A fragment having a naturalistic design of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>ducks embroidered in gold and green on a dark brown
background has been found. These designs were sometimes
woven into the material, sometimes embroidered,
and very frequently painted upon the materials.
Border designs beaten out in thin gold were not infrequently
stitched onto the dress.</p>

<p class='c014'>The chief and indispensable garment of a Greek
woman was her peplos, which was a piece of material
sewed together, open at top and bottom, and reaching
from the neck to the feet. The width was equal to the
extended arms. It was fastened over the shoulders
with a kind of pin or fibula and about the waist with
a girdle. Under this she wore a short undergarment.
A similar but much shorter and simpler chiton was
sometimes worn by the Greek men. The outer garment
for both men and women was a kind of cloak
or mantle made from an oblong of wool, 7 or 8 feet
long by 5 or 6 feet wide. There were many ways of
wearing this garment which was called the “himation.”
Here is a description of the toilet of the Goddess
Hera: “Then she clad her in her fragrant robe,
that Athena wrought delicately for her, and therein
set many things beautifully made, and fastened it
over her breast with clasps of gold. And she girdled it
with a girdle arrayed with a hundred tassels, and she
set earrings in her pierced ears—earrings of three
drops and glistening—and therefrom shone grace
abundantly. And with a veil over all, the peerless
goddess veiled herself—a fair, new veil, bright as the
sun, and beneath her shining feet she bound goodly
sandals.” (Lang, Leaf, &#38; Myers.)</p>

<p class='c020'><i>Roman Costumes.</i> Roman dress was patterned after
the Greek. It was unbelievably ample. The toga was
a huge elliptical piece of cloth in length three times
the height of the person who wore it and in width
twice his height. Imagine the skill required to arrange
this garment. The toga was of thin white woolen
stuff. When bordered with purple, it denoted a person
holding public office. A purple toga was always a
mark of high office. It was sometimes embroidered in
gold. Under the toga was worn a short garment called
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>the tunica, which corresponded to the Greek chiton.
The dress of a Roman matron corresponded to that
of a Roman man. She wore a tunica, loose and without
sleeves. Over this a stola which was belted at the
waist and had sleeves. Out of doors, she wore the
palla, which is identical with the Greek himation.
Sandals and sometimes shoes were worn on the feet.
These were bright colored and sometimes embroidered
with gold and pearls. Roman jewelry lacked
Greek refinement.</p>

<p class='c020'><cite>Costumes of the Early Church.</cite> What could be more
dignified and beautiful than a mask built upon the
history of the early church! The costumes for such a
mask would be ecclesiastical in character and would
reflect the influences of the Eastern and Western
worlds. The materials of these costumes would be rich
and colorful and of Byzantine design. The lines of
the costumes would very closely resemble the state
dresses of the Roman official dignitaries. The illustration
shows how elaborate were the vestments of a
bishop. In marked contrast but equally interesting
were the habits worn by the monastic orders. Here
is a brief description of the habits of several of
these:</p>

<p class='c014'>Benedictines wore gowns of black, white, or russet
cloth, with white or black fur, and black cape and
hood.</p>

<p class='c014'>Augustines wore black cassocks under white full-sleeved
tunics, over all black cloak and hood, square
black cap.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>Crossed Friars wore blue habits with a plain red
cross.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the early church there were various orders of
nuns. They lived in convents, apart from the world,
and took the vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience.
Their costumes were of extreme simplicity and dignity,
in keeping with their religious ideas. Each order
had a distinctive costume of gray, blue, brown, white,
or black. The materials were wool and linen. Note the
full mantle, sleeves, and head-covering.</p>

<p class='c020'><i>Crusaders’ Costumes.</i> Every boy and girl who loves
adventures has no doubt been thrilled by stories of
the Crusaders. The story of Richard the Lion-hearted
may come to your mind. This illustration shows you
the kind of costumes that he and other Crusaders
wore. Beginning in the year 1096, and during the two
hundred years which followed, there were nine crusades.
People from every country in Europe and from
every class set forth for the conquest of Jerusalem
and the recovery of the Holy Sepulcher. When these
great companies of people set forth each wore the
costume of his own country and class, but upon each
surcoat was worn the cross. According to the order
of Pope Urban II which read: “You are a soldier of
the Cross, wear, then, on your shoulder the blood-red
sign of Him who died for the salvation of your souls.”
What a sight it must have been! Godfrey of Bouillon
set forth from his province of Lorraine with 10,000
horsemen and 80,000 infantry, all bearing this
blood-red cross upon their surcoats. Raymond of Toulouse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>led forth, it is said, with 160,000 horse and foot.</p>

<p class='c014'>Out of the successes and failures of these great pilgrimages
came the experience and inspiration that
created the literature, architecture, and arts of the
Middle Ages, and gave the Christian world many of
its saints and martyrs.</p>

<p class='c020'><cite>XIIIth Century Costumes.</cite> One of the greatest expressions
of this intensely religious age was the cathedrals.
From the infinite number of statues that are
carved upon their façades and especially their portals
and those statues that are within the cathedrals,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>from the figures in their stained-glass windows, the
brass effigies in their pavements, and their frescoes
and paintings, came the most authentic and complete
information about the costumes of this period. Illuminated
manuscripts and tapestries, such as the Bayeux
tapestry, are also valuable sources. Photographs
and reproductions of all this material are available.
If one is seriously interested in costume he can
collect reproductions from a surprising number of
sources, such as newspapers, especially the Sunday
supplement, magazines, and postcards, and make
them into a costume scrapbook.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>The history of England from the time of William
the Conqueror to that of King John and Magna Carta
furnishes a wealth of material for the mask. Stories of
William the Conqueror, Robin Hood and his Merry
Men, the Canterbury Pilgrims and Ivanhoe, will come
to your mind. English costumes show little change
from the IXth to the XIVth Century. The men wore
a sleeved tunic, rather short, partly open at the sides,
confined by a girdle. Over this tunic, usually very
plain, was worn a mantle. It was a universal custom
to cross-bandage the legs from the knee down.
Pointed caps and shoes or low boots were worn.
Women wore long tunics or gowns with close-fitting
sleeves, made loose and girt in about the waist. A
short tunic with very wide sleeves at the wrist was
worn over this. This garment was often richly embroidered.
For the out of doors there was an extra
mantle with hood. Beautiful ornaments of gold and
bronze were worn by both men and women. Coverchiefs
were worn over the head, encircling the face
and covering the throat and shoulders. The coverchief
later became the wimple. Women wore their hair
flowing or in two braids brought forward over the
shoulders. The men wore flowing hair and the two-pointed
beard. The garments of royal persons were
made of very rich materials.</p>

<p class='c014'>An illuminated portrait of Eleanor of Acquitaine
represents her “with a wimple with a circlet of gems;
her under tunic fitting closely and having tight sleeves
is gathered into a rich collar about her throat; over
this dress is a long tunic, loose and flowing, bordered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>with ermine, its full and open sleeves being lined with
fur; and over all, there is the ever-present mantle so
adjusted that at the pleasure of the wearer it might
be drawn over the head.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Richard the Lion-hearted wore over a white under
tunic a longer tunic and an almost equally long crimson
dalmatic slit up at the sides. The latter garment
had very full sleeves. The mantle of royal blue and
gold was fastened in the center over the chest by a
large morse. He wore gloves jeweled at the back of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>the hand, and enriched boots with spurs attached
with buckled straps.</p>

<p class='c014'>Here is a description of a XIIIth Century costume

in a white damask tunic with jeweled girdle
and gloves, his mantle being of red satin embroidered
with sapphires and pearls.</p>

<p class='c020'><i>XVth Century Costumes.</i> Romances and ballads
founded upon tales of chivalry are colorful material
for the mask. These are most frequently laid in the
XIVth and XVth centuries. This was the time when
heraldry was at its height and there was great interest
in armorial devices. These appeared on the rich costumes
of the time, which were made from silk, satin,
velvet, and cloth of gold. Women wore very long and
full skirts, tight waists and sleeves. Rows of buttons
appear on waists and sleeves. There is a loose girdle
about the hips. The horned, steeple, and butterfly
headdresses were most extravagant. Shoes had long,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>pointed toes. Long mantles were popular. The costumes
of the men of the same century consisted of a
tight-fitting tunic with tight sleeves, rows of buttons,
loose girdle, long hose, shoes with pointed toes.
Mantles were of the richest materials and these were
splendidly adorned.</p>

<p class='c020'><cite>XVIth Century Costumes.</cite> Masks founded on the life
of Columbus and the discovery of America will require
costumes following those of the XVIth Century.
The costume for men show trunk hose, a jerkin or
jacket closed at the throat, sleeves cut and slashed,
and a very short coat that was called a doublet. In
addition to this there was a very full cloak or cape
that hung from the shoulder; a little flat cap was
worn with this costume. Short hair came into style
early in this century. Women wore full skirts, sometimes
extended by a kind of wheellike frame of whalebone
that was known as a “farthingale,” tight waists,
puffed and slashed sleeves, and wide muffs. The world
was ransacked to find stuffs to satisfy the extravagance
of the XVIth Century.</p>

<p class='c014'>The colonial history of the United States is rich in
material for pageants and masks. What could be
more vivid and interesting than the story of the Pilgrims,
Dutch founders of New York, or of the Cavaliers
of Virginia? The costumes of these periods are
well known to you.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Cavalier of the XVIIth Century continued the
extravagance of the XVIth Century. His hat was
wide brimmed and befeathered. There was lace at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>his neck, wrist, and boot top. His doublet let his fine
cambric shirt be seen at the waist.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>The women were equally elegant. Loose sleeves
were turned up at the elbows with bows of ribbon.
A tight-fitting bodice came down over a full skirt
divided in front to show an elaborate underskirt. A
wide collar covered the shoulders. This was a time
of patches, hair powder, face paints, great feather
fans, and muffs of fur, and the wearing of small black
masks, presumably as a protection from the sun.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>The costume of the XVIIth Century most familiar
to us is that of the Pilgrim. It reflects the protest
against the worldliness and extravagance of the time.
The hat was wide-brimmed and high-crowned, with
a wide ribbon band. Plain, wide collars of linen fell
over the shoulders of their simply cut garments,
which were of home-spun linen or wool. Not all Pilgrims
wore somber gray, brown, or black. Many
chose deep red, blue, or plum color.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Colonial costume followed the XVIIth Century
costume in America. It was directly influenced
by the fashions set by Louis XV and Louis XVI.
The costumes of the men of fashion of the colonies
were made from satins, laces, and embroideries imported
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>from France. Their periwigs and their enameled
and jeweled snuffboxes were also French. The
ladies of this period were equally exquisite. They
wore full flounced skirts over huge whaleboned petticoats
and tight bodices. Sloping shoulders, powdered
wigs, painted faces, and patches were the fashion.</p>

<div class='ic003'>
<p><i>XVIIIth Century Colonial Costumes</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>When you have decided upon the costume you wish
to make, then comes the very practical problem of
materials. These need not be expensive since satins,
unbleached muslin, cambric, tarlatan, cheesecloth,
and oilcloth can be made to give beautiful effects.
The advantages of satin are that it has body and texture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>and comes in a great range of colors. It has the
sheen of satin, and is fairly inexpensive. It can be
block printed or stenciled with gold, silver, or colors,
and made to resemble the richest fabrics. Cambric is
less expensive, but has less body and texture. It, too,
can be made very effective by block printing or stenciling.
Designs taken from fine old textiles in museums
or from books or plates can be sketched or traced and
then adapted for stencil or block.</p>

<p class='c014'>Cloth of gold or silver can be made by painting
muslin, gauze, or net with gold or silver radiator
paint. This can be stenciled by brushing the stencil
pattern with rabbit’s foot glue, then removing the
stencil and sprinkling the design with gold or silver
powder. There are no materials more satisfactory
than unbleached muslin or cheesecloth when they
have been dyed. These are very inexpensive. The
dyeing is not difficult and gives beautiful results for
the small amount of time and effort spent. The better
standard dyes are very satisfactory, and can be used
either hot or cold. By combining the dyes in the same
way that you would mix pigments (see page 94) you
can produce any true tint or shade that you wish.</p>

<p class='c014'>Rich effects are often produced by a second and
third dipping. Very often colored cheesecloth gains
by being redipped. As an illustration, a piece of blue
cheesecloth dipped in a green dye bath becomes a
lovely blue-green. Experiment with small pieces of
your material before you dip the larger pieces.</p>

<p class='c014'>The accessories of costumes, such as chains,
brooches, girdles, and scabbards are often necessary.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>Beads of glass, wood, clay, macaroni, and various
seeds can be painted, enameled, or gilded, and set
into papier-mâché for crowns, brooches, bracelets,
and earrings. Buttons and glass ornaments can be
used in the same way.</p>

<p class='c014'>The design of a costume must be considered even
more than its materials. A designer is an artist who
uses fabric, color, and line to create an impression
and to express an idea. He should study the play,
and understand its dramatic ideas and moods. If he
does this, his costumes will be as expressive, if properly
worn, as the words of the actors.</p>

<p class='c014'>Historic costumes reflect in a remarkable way the
life, tastes, and feelings of an earlier time. But historic
costumes also require an artist to reproduce
them. The designer of an historic costume should
know a great deal about the people who first wore
this particular kind of costume and why they wore it.
He will then choose suitable materials and colors, and
will try to reproduce characteristic lines and silhouettes.</p>

<p class='c014'>Last but not least comes the wearing of a costume.
This requires two very important things: intelligence
and imagination. The wearer, as well as the designer,
should know the life, customs, and manners of the
period which the costume represents. If he does not
know them how can he move and gesture and assume
the characteristic attitudes which the period demands
and bring the costume into harmonious relation with
the setting?</p>

<p class='c014'>A mask requires but few properties. A throne, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>chair, or a stool may be sufficient, if well designed and
of the proper period. A rich, colorful hanging or rug
against a neutral background will draw your stage
picture together and add dignity to a scene.</p>

<p class='c014'>The throne and stool shown in the photograph on
page 178 were made from beaver board, after designs
of Gothic furniture. The design was first drawn on
the beaver board; to the design were then glued
pieces of rope clothesline, while small rolls of papier-mâché
were glued on for the lowest relief. The entire
surface was then covered with pieces of unbleached
muslin which had been soaked in whiting, glue, and
warm water. When this was dry a coat of dark earth-brown
oil paint was applied. Lastly a small amount
of gold was rubbed over the design. The result resembled
rich carved wood.</p>

<p class='c014'>Much can be done with papier-mâché in the making
of minor properties, such as croziers, maces, harps,
lutes, jewel boxes, helmets, shields, sword handles,
and scabbards. Properties should add to the beauty
of a scene, never dominate it. They will be much more
convincing when they suggest rather than minutely
imitate the actual object. A background may be no
more than a box hedge and still be most charming.</p>

<p class='c014'>Everyone is familiar with the beauty of woodland
settings. Masks of spring, summer, and the harvest
time of Shakespearean plays almost demand some
such setting.</p>

<p class='c014'>Masks of winter bring us indoors. Possibly the best
indoor background is the simple gray curtain of velvet,
velveteen, monks’ cloth, outing flannel, or cambric.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>Against it costumes are seen to advantage and
lights of all colors may be thrown against it successfully.</p>

<p class='c014'>Since a mask is a highly conventionalized form of
drama, it is possible to use a background painted with
appropriate decorative or symbolic designs. An illustration
of this is the symbolic pine tree painted on the
wall of the temple courtyard for the Japanese <i>No</i>
dramas. Screens of various kinds are full of possibilities.
In the church or Sunday school, classroom, auditorium,
library, or settlement, in the yard, playground,
or park, ingenuity, imagination, and taste
will always create a fitting background.</p>

<h3 class='c002'><span class='c012'>CHAPTER V</span><br> The Mask with Pantomime, Music, and Dance</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>The wearing of masks made it difficult for the
Greek actors to speak their lines. Naturally they came
to rely upon gestures quite as much as upon words to
carry their meaning to the audience. This interpretation
by gesture led to the development of the art of
pantomime.</p>

<p class='c014'>The great pantomimists had wit and humor. They
knew how to take a story and improve it in the telling.
Their hands expressed more than their words, and
their gestures were a language that all understood.
Masks made it possible for each actor to assume
different rôles, and his mimicking was in keeping with
the character of the mask he wore.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was no unusual thing in the Greek towns and
cities to see a jolly company of these mimes and musicians
in grotesque costumes, their faces masked or
smeared with soot, riding in chariots through the
streets so that they might advertise their plays.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>These plays were little dramas and comedies in which
pantomime and music played an important part.</p>

<p class='c014'>Pantomime was popular with the Romans and for
this reason despised by the early Christians. It survived,
nevertheless, through a few obscure actors and
mountebanks. Gradually these mimics and their fellows
banded themselves together. They appeared at
festivals whenever they were summoned, only to disappear
afterward into the deep obscurity of a stroller’s
life.</p>

<p class='c014'>The mimics, or jongleurs (as they were called in
France in the early Middle Ages), kept alive the tradition
of dramatic entertainment. Among the famous
mimics was Taillefer, who rode into the battle of
Hastings tossing his sword into the air and catching
it again, while he sang songs of Roland and Charlemagne.
In France and in England the pantomimist
was welcome in castle, in convent, and on village
green.</p>

<p class='c014'>From the Vth Century on, the Church gave much
thought to forms of dramatic public worship, and
sought thereby to interest and instruct the people.
Living pictures, accompanied by songs, were used to
illustrate the gospel narrative. On great festival days,
such as Christmas, Good Friday, and Easter, the
priests performed in pantomime the incidents appropriate
to the occasion. Out of these very simple rites
grew the mysteries, miracles, and the elaborate morality
plays in which pantomime played a very important
part.</p>

<p class='c014'>In addition to such sacred plays, there were no end
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>of secular plays. These were given all over Europe by
townsfolk and peasants, in the streets, at the fairs,
and in the great halls of the castles. Among the most
popular of the English folk plays were the St. George
plays. These were acted at Christmas time by bands
of masked townsmen and peasants who called themselves
mummers. Several versions of these old St.
George plays, which can still be adapted and used in
a Christmas mask, have come down to us. Among
the characters are St. George, the Doctor, Little Jack,
Father Christmas, the old dragon, and the Morris men.</p>

<p class='c014'>In Italy during the XVIth and XVIIth centuries
there was a popular form of character comedy that
was known as the <cite>Commedia dell’ arte</cite>. This was performed
by bands of professional actors who strolled
about the country giving their improvised plays to
any chance audience. As time went on and their
popularity grew, the more clever of these bands established
themselves in theaters in the towns and cities,
where they gave a great variety of performances.
The principal characters of their plays were Harlequin,
Scaramouch, Columbine, Pantalone, and Punchinello.
These characters all wore masks and were
adepts in the art of pantomime. These Italian musicians
and actors of the <cite>Commedia dell’ arte</cite> traveled
to Spain, France, and finally to England, where their
boisterous humor was warmly welcomed by high and
low. Here is an account of one part of the festivities
that were given in Kenilworth, in the year 1576:</p>

<p class='c014'>“Noow within allso&#160;... waz thear showed before
her Highness by an Italian, such feats of agilitie, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>goinges, turninges, tumblinges, castinges, hops, jumps,
leaps, skips, springs, gambauds, soomersaults, caprittiez
and flights; forward, backward, sydewize, a
downward, upward, and with sundry windings, gyrings
and circumflexions; allso lightly and with such
easiness, as by me in feaw words it is not expressible
by pen or speech&#160;... I bleast me by my faith to behold
him, and began to doout whither a waz a man or a
spirite.... Az for thiz fellow I cannot tell what to
make of him, save that I may geese his back be metalld
like a lamprey, that haz no bones but a line like
a lute-string.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Pantomime was popular in England during the
Reformation and morality plays were given in dumb
show.</p>

<p class='c014'>French actors were greatly influenced by these
clever traveling Italian artists. They set up similar
plays at their great fairs and finally established a
theater in Paris, in which music and pantomime were
developed to the highest perfection.</p>

<p class='c014'>Until recent years nearly all that we have known of
the great tradition of pantomime came to us through
the circus clowns. Among these were a few artists
such as Grimaldi, who never allowed their art to
become low and trivial.</p>

<p class='c014'>Now, all this is quite changed, since the coming of
the movie. The moving picture depends entirely upon
pantomime for interpreting character and expressing
emotion. The greatest of the movie actors are great
pantomimists. When we study the movements and
gestures and the facial expressions of such actors as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>Emil Jannings and Charlie Chaplin, we begin to understand
what pantomime really is. Chaliapin is another
great actor who understands the art of pantomime
and uses it in opera.</p>

<p class='c014'>Let us see how pantomime, music, and dance were
used in the Christmas mask described at the end of
chapter II “Occasions for Wearing the Mask.” Masks
for this play had been made for the following characters:
a dignified king, a mournful queen, a gentle lady-in-waiting,
an austere learned bishop, a faithful son,
a clever jester, a rollicking band of mummers. Each
pupil had made his own mask after very thorough
study of the character that he had chosen. Knowing
his character well enabled each student to interpret
that character when he put on his mask, and for the
time of the play, each student sought to become that
character, king, queen, bishop, or mummer. The
problem for each actor was that of bringing his movements
and gestures into harmony with his mask. The
king’s movements should be no less dignified and
stately than his mask suggested. The unhappy queen
must express the sadness of her mask by her drooping
head and shoulders and by her impassive hands. Her
mask was so modeled that when lifted, it suggested a
smile. This expression was required when she lifted
her head in joy at her son’s return.</p>

<p class='c014'>The lady-in-waiting used pantomime to interpret
her gentleness and modesty and the music which accompanied
her XIIIth Century song. This song, sung
off stage by one of the chorus, was singularly appropriate
to the pensive quality of her mask.</p>

<p class='c014'>The jester used pantomime in his dance. His inspiration
for his poses came from the illustrations in old
manuscripts and reproductions of old manuscripts.
He sketches these, and then, assisted by a teacher
who understood folk dancing, he worked out every
step and pose to the music of this, his song:</p>

<p class='c014'>What can the mask, the age-old form of entertainment,
give us to-day? It is so far from mere representation
that it allows us to escape from realism and to
enter freely into the world of fine and subtle character
interpretation. It is a form of entertainment that
lends itself to humor, to dignity, and to beauty, and
enlists the finest creative effort.</p>

<h3 class='c002'><span class='c012'>CHAPTER I</span><br> The Mystery of the Shadow</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>The life of primitive man was full of peril. Out
of the struggle to survive the dangers which threatened
him on every side came fear and superstition.
He developed a great regard for shadows which he
could not understand. They were mysterious, they
moved and changed, appeared and disappeared. They
eluded him and yet pursued him. The shadow became
for him a living thing. Gradually he came to look upon
his own shadow as his very soul. He felt that he must
shield and protect it. Consequently he would permit
no one to step upon it, or even to touch it.</p>

<p class='c014'>Stories of regard for the shadow come from many
lands. The natives of Nias, an island in the Dutch
East Indies, greatly feared the rainbow, because to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>them it was a powerful net set by a great spirit to
catch their shadows, and to destroy them.</p>

<p class='c014'>Savages of Wetar, a neighboring island, believe that
a man can be made ill unto death if his shadow is
stabbed, while the Ottawa Indians believed that a
man will die if certain figures are drawn upon his
shadow, and the Bushmen of Australia never allow
their shadows to fall upon dead game. They are confident
that bad luck will follow them if they do so.
When a Malay builds a house, he takes the greatest
care to prevent his shadow from falling into the hole
that is being dug for the center post. If, by chance,
his shadow should fall into the hole, he feels certain
that sickness and trouble will follow him.</p>

<p class='c014'>Here is a curious tale that comes from India. A
priest named Saukara disagreed with the grand lama.
In order to show his supernatural powers he soared
far up into the sky, his long shadow falling on the
ground. When the lama saw this shadow moving
along on the ground, he drew out his sword and struck
it. Saukara fell to the earth.</p>

<p class='c014'>In Africa, the natives believe that even trees must
guard their shadows. This is especially true of the
trees that have medicinal leaves. A Kaffir doctor runs
up very quickly to one of these medicinal trees and
tries to avoid stepping on its shadow lest the shadow
inform the tree of his coming and give it time to withdraw
the healing properties of its leaves into the
trunk.</p>

<p class='c014'>One of the strangest customs that has existed since
the time of the Greeks is still practised in southeastern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>Europe. It is that of measuring a strong man’s shadow
and then of building the measuring line into the
foundations of a building. The people believe that the
strength of the man goes into the structure. In Roumania
one frequently hears when passing a building
under construction this warning cry: “Beware lest
they take thy shadow.” There are certain people who
go about stealthily measuring the shadows of strong
men. They sell these shadow measuring lines to the
architects.</p>

<p class='c014'>Gradually the superstitious fear of shadows passed.
In the place of this fear came an interest in using
shadows for entertainment. This may have been suggested
by the shadows that fell on the walls of the
sacred tent while the priests within were performing
the holy rites.</p>

<p class='c014'>Shadow plays originated in the Orient and are
known in every Eastern country. Here is a tale of
their Chinese origin. An emperor grew angry with his
two court fools, and ordered their heads cut off. When
his anger cooled, he began to feel that life was dull.
He then ordered his grand vizier to bring his fools
back to life. At this command, the vizier was almost
at his wit’s end for he knew that he would lose his
own head if he could not fulfil the royal command.
One day he met a fisherman with two great fishes. It
suddenly occurred to him that he might take the
skins of these fishes, dry them, and cut out from them
two figures that would look like the two jesters. He
succeeded in doing this, and after much thought and
labor, he was able once more to show the Emperor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>his fools, this time as shadows against a lighted curtain,
acting for his entertainment. These shadows
seemed to please the Emperor even more than the
living jesters.</p>

<p class='c014'>In all Eastern countries the people usually prefer
flat shadow figures to round marionettes. Such shadow
figures are made from the carefully prepared skin
of a goat or buffalo. After it has been stretched and
dried, a clever artist takes the translucent skin and
cuts out from it figures which represent the gods and
heroes of the people. The illustration shows a characteristic
Javanese shadow figure. The elaborate pattern
is made by means of many small holes of different
shapes and sizes. This figure is further enriched with
transparent colors and gold. The arms are jointed at
the shoulder and the elbow. Slender rods of wood,
bone, or ivory are then fastened to the body and arms.
The puppeteer manipulates the figure by means of
these rods which extend below the figure. The shapes
of the figures are most interesting, as you can see,
with their strange headdresses, long noses, thin arms
and legs. Their gestures are so grotesque and fascinating
that they are like the strange people one meets
only in dreams.</p>

<p class='c014'>The theaters in which these shadow figures are
shown are often no more than an angle of two walls
before which is hung an opaque curtain in which there
is a small opening with a bit of very fine linen
stretched over it. This is lighted from behind. Here
the showman sits with his figures all about him. And
a very clever fellow he must be! Think of all the things
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>he must do. First, he must know by heart all the stories
that the people may wish to see acted, then he
must know how to make the proper speech for each
of his puppets, as well as how to make it act its part
with the proper feeling and gestures. Further, he
must be able to direct the orchestra of several men
playing tomtoms, to manage his lights, and to shuffle
his feet when that is necessary.</p>

<p class='c014'>Can you guess how many puppets belong to his
set? Count the characters in your favorite plays. If
you take a long play like Shakespeare’s <cite>Midsummer
Night’s Dream</cite>, and include a great band of fairies,
there will scarcely be more than fifty characters. This
showman has from sixty to one hundred and twenty
shadows in his set. He must know just where every
one is placed so that he can put his hand upon it the
moment it is needed. He must also please people of
many different tastes, therefore he must be able to
give serious plays; plays about the gods, about giants
and dragons, elves and fairies. Besides all of this he
must know a great many hero plays, for it is through
his art that the great heroes are kept alive.</p>

<p class='c014'>Omar Khayyam, the Persian poet, compared life
itself to a shadow-show.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>

      <div class='line'>Round which we Phantom Figures come and go.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The shadow figures of Oriental countries differ
widely. For example, those of China are as beautiful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>in pattern and in color as those of the Javanese but
are much less grotesque. The Turkish shadow figures
are less beautiful than the Chinese and Javanese
figures. They are very cleverly articulated, however,
and so skilfully manipulated that they furnish the
most common and popular form of dramatic entertainment.
Black Eye or <i>Karagheuz</i> is the rogue
hero, and is known throughout Turkey and the whole
of northern Africa. The Karagheuz shows are the
usual attraction of Greek and Turkish coffee houses.</p>

<p class='c014'>Among the many things that came to Europe
through trading with the Orient were Chinese shadow
figures. They probably reached England early in the
XVIth Century.</p>

<p class='c014'>We know that the clever showman, Powell, used
motions or shadows in his <cite>Old Creation of the World
with the Addition of Noah’s Flood</cite>, in 1641. More
than a century later Chinese shadow plays came
under royal favor in France. There they have been
changed and adapted in many ways. The modern
French shadow plays are pretentious, with many
scenes and numerous characters. All the countries of
Europe have made some use of the cut-out shadow
figures.</p>

<p class='c014'>Recently cut-out shadow figures have found a
rival. This has come about through the growing appreciation
of the dramatic possibilities of the human
shadow figure. Modern lighting has done much
toward this end, because it has made possible a clearly
defined silhouette on the shadow screen.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>The art of the human shadow is not limited. It
uses acting, dancing, music, the voice, and color.
With a sense of design and arrangement, a beautiful
picture is created before the audience every moment.
The human shadow play is a new challenge to imagination,
taste, and ingenuity.</p>

<h3 class='c002'><span class='c012'>CHAPTER II</span><br> Making a Shadow Play</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>It is not at all difficult to make a shadow play if
one knows what the requirements are. The first requirement
of either a cut-out shadow play or a human
play is that its story shall have action. In this it is
like a movie. You will recall how keenly you enjoy
the action in such movies as <cite>Robin Hood</cite> and the
<cite>Black Pirate</cite>. The second requirement is a dramatic
plan or problem. This is necessary in order to hold the
attention of the audience. For example, the dramatic
plan or problem in the <cite>Black Pirate</cite> is the struggle
of the hero to free himself from the pirates. Your attention
is held by this struggle. The third requirement
is the selection of the most important and interesting
characters in the play. Since the success of a shadow
play depends upon interesting silhouettes, each character
must have individuality. No two silhouettes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>should be alike, either in appearance or size. As an
illustration of this, notice that the shadow figures at
the top of page 215 are of different appearance and
height. Lastly, the settings of a shadow play should
be very simple and suggestive and help to tell the
story.</p>

<p class='c014'>Nursery rhymes and fables, folk and fairy tales are
delightful material for cut-out shadow plays. They
are vivid, humorous, and fanciful. They are full of
direct conversation which can be carried on by the
puppeteers behind the screen or by a reader in front
of the screen. In the following list you may find a
story to turn into a cut-out shadow play. Nursery
rhymes such as: <cite>Little Bo Peep</cite>, <cite>Old King Cole</cite>,
<cite>The Knave of Hearts</cite>, <cite>A Frog Who Would A-Wooing
Go</cite>, and <cite>The House That Jack Built</cite>. Fables such as
those of Æsop, La Fontaine, and Bidpai. Folk and
fairy tales, such as: <cite>Cinderella</cite>, <cite>Beauty and the Beast</cite>,
<cite>Jack and the Beanstalk</cite>, <cite>The Three Little Pigs</cite>, <cite>The
Elves and the Shoemaker</cite>, <cite>Seven at a Blow</cite>, <cite>Snow
White and the Dwarfs</cite>, <cite>The Three Bears</cite>, <cite>Red Riding
Hood</cite>, <cite>Aladdin and His Wonderful Lamp</cite>, <cite>Sleeping
Beauty</cite>, <cite>The Mermaid</cite>, <cite>Just-So Stories</cite>, <cite>Three Billy
Goats Gruff</cite>, <cite>The Traveling Musicians of Bremen</cite>, and
<cite>The Pied Piper of Hamelin Town</cite>. Bible stories can
be turned into beautiful shadow plays. For example,
David and Goliath, Daniel in the Lion’s Den, Jonah
and the Whale, and Joseph and His Brethren.</p>

<p class='c014'>Tales of heroism and adventure, ballads and poems,
stories of Christmas and Easter, Bible stories and
stories of the lives of the saints are appropriate for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>human shadow plays because they have great human
interest and give opportunity for dramatic interpretation.
The following list may be a guide to you in
choosing your play: William Tell, Robin Hood, King
Arthur, Roland and Oliver, Hiawatha, The Cid,
Joseph and His Brethren, The Story of Moses, David
and Jonathan, David Before Saul, The Good Samaritan,
The Story of Ruth, The Story of Queen Esther,
The Story of St. Francis of Assisi, The Nativity, The
Christ-child Legend, Where Love Is There God Is.
Also, and Christmas carols such as: Good King
Wenceslaus, We Three Kings of the Orient Are,
Here We Come A Wassailing, and Little Town of
Bethlehem.</p>

<p class='c014'>Boys and girls who have originality and a gift for
writing will find great pleasure in making their own
shadow plays. These can be done either in prose or
in verse. They can do this easily, if they keep in mind
the requirements—action, dramatic interest, individuality
of characters, and a simple, harmonious setting.
It is worth trying.</p>

<h3 class='c002'><span class='c012'>CHAPTER III</span><br> Producing Cut-out Shadow Plays</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>When you were very young you probably were
quite skilful in making shadow rabbits, ducks, and
donkeys on the nursery walls. With a friend you may
have cut out paper animals and people and fastened
them to sticks and then made a shadow play with
their shadows on the wall.</p>

<p class='c014'>Your interest in shadows may have led you to
stretch a sheet across the upper part of a doorway and
cover the lower part with a shawl. Here you stood
concealed from your audience while you moved your
shadow figures back and forth in a lively fashion as
you spoke the lines of a favorite nursery rhyme or
improvised a play.</p>

<p class='c014'>The next step was converting the old three-part
screen into a shadow booth.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>
<img src='images/i_p216.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic005'>
<p><i>The frame</i> (<i>A</i>), <i>upon which is fastened the translucent paper or cloth</i> (<i>B</i>), <i>slides in and out of the standard at the grooves C, C.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>When one wishes to use scenery with cut-out shadows
some sort of frame is necessary to hold the
screen. Here is a plan for a very simple and inexpensive
standard. You can see that you can have any
number of screens for this kind of standard, because
it allows the screens to be slipped in and out in a
moment. The materials required other than the lumber
are unbleached muslin or cheap white window
shades and black showcard colors, and a few brushes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>of different sizes. The muslin should be stretched and
tacked to the frame. If you use a window shade it
will not be necessary to stretch it and it provides an
excellent surface on which to paint the scenery.</p>

<p class='c014'>Making a shadow play is jolly good fun. First,
make a list of the most important incidents in the
story. Second, decide upon the number of scenes that
you think necessary for your play. Third, decide upon
the number of characters required for these scenes.
You will be surprised to find how few characters and
incidents are needed to tell your story. Choose only
those which are most important. Know your story
well before you begin. Let us choose the traveling
musicians of Bremen for our play. The list of important
incidents are as follows:</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>

    </dd>
    <dt>Incident  XVII—</dt>
    <dd>The robber flees to his companions
    </dd>
    <dt>Incident XVIII—</dt>
    <dd>The robber describes the witch that clawed him, the demon that stabbed him, the giant 
    that beat him with a club, the fateful spirit on the roof that screamed “Throw him up to

    <dt>Scene   I—</dt>
    <dd>The roadside
    </dd>
    <dt>Scene  II—</dt>
    <dd>The deep wood

    <dd>The robbers’ house
    </dd>
    <dt>Scene  IV—</dt>
    <dd>The roadside
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c014'>These four scenes require twelve characters: Donkey,
Dog, Cat, Cock, Four Robbers, Witch, Demon,
Giant, and the fateful spirit. Each character must
be analyzed, for both disposition and general appearance.</p>

<p class='c014'>Shadow figures require careful planning, because
they present but one silhouette throughout the play.
Naturally this silhouette must be the most characteristic
one. The shape of the nose, chin, and head, of the
hands, the feet, and the body, all must be closely
studied. Let us see how a shadow figure is made. Let
us begin with the Donkey. He looks old, thin, and
neglected, but he still has spirit enough to start out
into the world. His thin body and neck show that he
is old and misused. His strong jaw shows his will and
determination. Before you draw him on a piece of
paper you should decide on his size. The scale is determined
by the size of the shadow screen. Let us
suppose that this is 21 inches by 28 inches and that
your scale is two inches to the foot. The Donkey is
made about 8½ inches high by 10 inches long, the robbers
11 and 12 inches high, the Dog four inches high
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>by 4½ inches long, and the Cock 3 inches high by 4¼
inches long. After you have drawn the Donkey to
scale, cut him out and hold him behind a sheet of
paper near the light and study his silhouette. Are
you satisfied? If not, draw another donkey.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_p219.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic005'>
<p><i>Moving parts are pivoted with paper fasteners (a). Wires running up the sticks</i> (<i>f</i>) <i>to move the tail, neck and jaw are looped through the eyelets</i> (<i>c</i>). <i>Thumb tacks</i> (<i>b</i>) <i>or glue may be used to fasten the figure to the sticks. Pivot points should be eyeletted before inserting the fasteners; for greater ease in working, it is sometimes well to let the head of a fastener come between two parts as at</i> (<i>e</i>). <i>The movement of the jaw piece blinks the eye which is cut at</i> (<i>d</i>).</p>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>
<img src='images/i_p220.jpg' alt='[Cut-outs]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c014'>What is the Donkey expected to do? Move his jaw
when he talks, move his tail and ears and his legs
when he walks. How can this be done? The illustration
may look very complicated at first. Study it
carefully and follow the directions and your donkey
will be able to walk, open and close his mouth,
blink his eyes, and move his tail and ears. The materials
that you will need are black construction paper
or any heavy paper, thin sticks about 2 inches long
and ⅜ inch wide, eyelets, and long-pronged brass
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>paper fasteners, thumb tacks, and light-weight wire.</p>

<p class='c014'>Not all shadow animals are as complicated as this
donkey. Here are a deer, a cock, and a dog, each
made of just three pieces of paper. The illustrations
of the farmer, fairy queen, and elf (see end of chapter)
will show how the human figures are made.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_p221.jpg' alt='[Cut-outs]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c014'>When you have finished constructing the cut-out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>shadow figures, your next problem will be making
the scenery. Composition and pattern are extremely
important in shadow pictures, for nothing in the world
reveals the fascination of dark and light more than
the shadow play. If you can recall the beauty of the
landscape in a heavy winter snowstorm when the
branches and trunks of the trees are velvety black
against masses of white, you can appreciate this.
Every tree has a characteristic silhouette which everyone
recognizes. A shadow pine tree must suggest the
silhouette of the pine, likewise the oak, the elm, and
the poplar, must suggest their silhouettes. So, too,
with flowers and grasses. The wide prairies were suggested
by the coarse prairie grass in the <cite>Indian and
the Oki</cite>. Summer meadows were suggested by the
flowers and slender grasses in <cite>The Shepherdess</cite>.</p>

<p class='c014'>When you have finished the plans for a scene take
crayon or soft pencil and draw it in outline on one of
the screens. Use black showcard color to fill that part
of your scene which is to be dark. For a black silhouette
paint both sides of the screen. Distant hills and
trees should be painted on one side only.</p>

<p class='c014'>For lighting use a lantern or an extension light.
Place it about six feet directly behind the screen.
Color can be thrown on the screen by placing a sheet
of colored gelatine in front of the light. Experiment
with the light and color until you get the effects you
wish.</p>

<p class='c014'>If you use tracing cloth, such as the architects use,
for your screen, you may paint on it directly, with
transparent water colors. When the light comes
through this screen, if you have kept your colors clear,
brilliant, and well related, the effect will be charming.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>The shadow figure is manipulated from below.
This means that you must stand below the screen so
that your own shadow will not be cast upon the
screen. As you bring your shadow figure forward, you
will notice that as it approaches the screen it grows
smaller and smaller. To prevent the figure from
varying in size it should be held close against the
screen.</p>

<p class='c014'>Unlike the marionette that moves forward and
backward as well as to the right and left, the shadow
figure can move only to the right or left. With this
limitation, however, it is surprising to find how many
movements and gestures are possible. Suit the action
to the word. Avoid jerky gestures and repetition of
the same gesture.</p>

<p class='c014'>The lines of the shadow play can be given by the
puppeteers or by a reader or readers in front of the
screen. If the puppeteers are to speak the lines they
should sit down together and read the play again and
again, until they can speak the lines naturally and
without hesitation. When they can do this, they are
ready to begin rehearsals with the shadow figures.
Do not hurry. Every word should be clearly spoken.</p>

<p class='c014'>If two or three short plays are being given in a
program, two readers, one standing at the left and
one at the right of the screen, can read the lines alternately.</p>

<p class='c014'>The shadow play is a delightful kind of entertainment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>for young and old. It is appropriate for the
home, the school, the settlement, and the Sunday
school. It has the advantage of requiring very little
time to produce, the materials are inexpensive, and
it is an artistic means of expression.</p>

<h3 class='c002'><span class='c012'>CHAPTER IV</span><br> Producing Human Shadow Plays</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>Did you ever feel about your shadow as Robert
Louis Stevenson did, when he wrote:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I have a little shadow,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>That goes in and out with me,</div>
      <div class='line'>And what can be the use of him,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Is more than I can see.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>If you ever took part in a shadow game, you discovered
many surprising uses for your shadow. You may
remember how you stretched a sheet in a doorway
and played the game of guessing silhouettes. This was
highly entertaining, and somewhat difficult when
familiar faces were disguised by unusual noses and
chins. Then there were the shadow charades and the
game of guessing book titles.</p>

<p class='c014'>If you wish to give a shadow play with scenery and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>several actors performing at one time, then a large
shadow screen becomes necessary. This can be made
from 2-inch strips of wood, strengthened in the corners
as shown in the illustration. The size of this
screen will be determined by the width of the sheeting
which is to cover it. The screen used at the Cleveland
Museum of Art for the shadow plays <cite>The Indian and
the Oki</cite> and <cite>The Shepherdess</cite> was 7¼ feet high by
12 feet long, and was covered with sheeting 90 inches
in width. Great care was used in the stretching of the
sheet. The tacks were placed about two inches apart.</p>

<p class='c014'>The reason for choosing <cite>The Indian and the Oki</cite>
for a shadow play was that it had action and characters
that were very individual, such as would be easily
recognized when they fell on the shadow screen. Another
reason for choosing this story was that its scenery
could be suggested by silhouettes. The group of
boys and girls who gave this play selected important
incidents of the story and re-arranged them and
added incidents wherever they found it necessary.
The following twelve incidents made up the first act:</p>

<p class='c014'>1. Rabbit wiggles ears, hops across stage.</p>

<p class='c014'>2. Sparrows scrap upon rock, first gently, growing
furious.</p>

<p class='c014'>3. Eagle swoops across and down upon rock; birds
leave.</p>

<p class='c014'>4. Wild cat moves slightly, winks eye, raises tail,
arches back ready for spring as</p>

<p class='c014'>5. Scandawatti peeps from rock, then disappears,
then Indian lad appears, with bow and arrow and
shoots at wild cat, hits bear.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>6. Bear bounds forward, pulls out arrow from
shoulder with teeth, eyes flash, rushes forward as lad
attempts to climb rock, misses hold at top, slips, almost
falls backward, bear ready to pounce.</p>

<p class='c014'>7. Achilles appears at right side, shoots quickly,
bear rolls over, Scandawatti leaps to feet, looks in
surprise from bear to Achilles, comes forward, examines
gun.</p>

<p class='c014'>8. Chief enters from right slowly, approaches boys,
lad tells him of escape.</p>

<p class='c014'>9. French trapper enters from left, approaches,
lays hand on Achilles, hears story. Scandawatti leads
way to Chief Iliol. Trapper gives pistols to both boys
who admire them. Chief nods satisfaction. Both
trapper and chief leave together to right.</p>

<p class='c014'>10. Boys examine, admire, and handle pistols.</p>

<p class='c014'>11. Red Deer sneaks from behind rock and looks
jealously at weapons, moves hands and body as if
eager to possess prize, disappears.</p>

<p class='c014'>12. Curtain closes as lads pledge friendship and
prepare to leave.</p>

<p class='c014'>The incidents chosen for the second act were:</p>

<p class='c014'>1. Squaw stirs stew in the kettle that hangs over
the fire.</p>

<p class='c014'>2. Trapper and Chief Iliol enter and sit down.
Squaw brings the pipe of peace. They smoke.</p>

<p class='c014'>3. An indian enters and dances to the tomtoms.
The trapper, chief, and dancer leave.</p>

<p class='c014'>4. Scandawatti enters with a basket full of fish and
Achilles with a game bag full of rabbits and ducks.
They give these to the squaw.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>5. Scandawatti and Achilles sit on the ground and
play with their pistols.</p>

<p class='c014'>6. Red Deer peers from behind bushes.</p>

<p class='c014'>7. Squaw gives each boy a bowl of the stew. They
eat greedily.</p>

<p class='c014'>8. Boys undo bundle in which there are knives and
beads. Achilles holds up the Oki or false face.</p>

<p class='c014'>9. Scandawatti, alarmed, jumps up and runs.
Achilles runs after him, carrying the Oki.</p>

<p class='c014'>10. Red Deer enters, stealthily, and reaches for the
pistols.</p>

<p class='c014'>11. Achilles lifts up the Oki from behind a rock.
Red Deer drops the pistols and flees.</p>

<p class='c014'>12. Scandawatti and Achilles enter laughing, pick
up weapons, wrap themselves in blankets, and lie
down to sleep.</p>

<p class='c014'>For the third act they chose the following:</p>

<p class='c014'>1. A turkey runs across the stage.</p>

<p class='c014'>2. Red Deer follows with Scandawatti. He binds
him to a tree, then runs after the turkey.</p>

<p class='c014'>3. Red Deer returns with dead turkey. Builds a fire
and places the turkey over it.</p>

<p class='c014'>4. Red Deer dances about, mocking Scandawatti.</p>

<p class='c014'>5. Achilles peeks from behind rock. Motions to
Scandawatti to have courage. Then sticks up the
Oki and waves it about in the air.</p>

<p class='c014'>6. Red Deer flies in terror.</p>

<p class='c014'>7. Achilles frees Scandawatti.</p>

<p class='c014'>8. They devour the turkey.</p>

<p class='c014'>9. The trapper and Indian chief appear and all rejoice.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>Shadow plays require just as careful character
analysis as any other kind of play. Here is the character
analysis.</p>

<p class='c014'>Scandawatti, brave, loyal, fun loving.</p>

<p class='c014'>Achilles, courageous, loyal, resourceful.</p>

<p class='c014'>Red Deer, treacherous and superstitious.</p>

<p class='c014'>Chief Iliol, trustworthy and dignified.</p>

<p class='c014'>Squaw, stolid and good-natured.</p>

<p class='c014'>Trapper, just and reliable.</p>

<p class='c014'>Dancer, lively.</p>

<p class='c014'>The story included the bear and turkey, the rabbit,
wild cat, hawk and birds were added for the sake of
the picture. The illustrations show how the turkey,
wild cat, and birds were made.</p>

<p class='c014'>The scenery consisted of tree trunks, branches, and
a big rock cut from beaver board, and foliage, flowers,
and grasses cut from light-weight bristol board.</p>

<p class='c014'>The properties needed were a tripod and a kettle, a
stick for the fire, a basket of corn, bowls and a ladle,
pistols, strings of beads, a game bag filled with paper
game, a fish basket filled with paper fish, bow and
arrow, gun, rope, two blankets, and a peace pipe.</p>

<p class='c014'>The costuming of a shadow play is quite a different
problem from the costuming of any other kind of
play. A costume may look quite right to the eye and
yet be ineffective as a shadow. It requires ingenuity
and much experimenting to produce satisfactory silhouettes.
Scandawatti, Red Deer, and the dancer
wore loin cloths, head band, and feathers. The Indian
chief wore headdress and blanket. The squaw wore a
fringed curtain, head band, and beads. The trapper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>and Achilles wore trappers’ costumes and coon-skin
caps. A boy took the part of the bear in a bear costume
made from outing flannel.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_p230.jpg' alt='[Cut-outs]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The profiles of the children were not in the least
Indianlike. It was necessary to provide them with
characteristic Indian noses and this was done by
glueing on flat cut-out paper noses.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>The producing of a shadow play requires a director
and two assistants, as well as the group of actors.
The director is responsible for the production of the
play which will probably require five or six rehearsals.
During the first rehearsal he stays behind the screen,
working out with the group each incident of the play.
He and the group decide upon the entrances, positions
on the bridge, the exits, and those who are to manipulate
the shadow animals receive their instructions.
The reader should be present at the first rehearsal, in
order to observe the development of the play. At this
rehearsal the actors need not be in costume. Each
actor begins by interpreting his part as he feels it
should be done. The Director should inspire and encourage
his actors to do their best and guard against
being too critical at this time, since everyone is feeling
his way—becoming familiar with properties, and
with this new kind of acting in one plane.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was in the first rehearsal of <cite>The Indian and the
Oki</cite> that the boy who took the part of Scandawatti
discovered, as he was trying to escape from the bear,
that it would look more natural if he got out of the
bear’s reach by climbing the rock, rather than by
dodging behind it. When a stepladder was placed
behind the beaver-board rock, the boy, after much
practice, was able to make it appear to the audience
that he was really climbing the rock. He was finally
able to give a little slip as he reached the top, just as
the bear was about to overtake him. This gave a real
thrill to the young spectators.</p>

<p class='c014'>At the second rehearsal the Director takes his position
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>in front of the screen. He watches every movement
and gesture of the actors. He guides the actors
who cannot see their shadows, because they are so
close to the screen. If he understands pattern and
rhythm he can direct their movements so that every
movement of the shadow play will be beautiful. The
reader begins his part at the second rehearsal. He
can give an introduction and carry the story on between
the acts, or he can read as the play is being
given. The reader may be a girl or a boy and should
be chosen for a rich, well-modulated voice, dramatic
sense, and ability to enunciate distinctly. The reader
should be appropriately costumed.</p>

<p class='c014'>Introducing a dancer in a shadow play presents a
problem. In the second scene of <cite>The Indian and the
Oki</cite> you can see in the illustration how the height,
and bulk, and dignity of the Indian chief on the left
and the curved line of the trapper’s body on the right
were used to frame the space for the rhythmic movements
of the dancer. The dancer also had his problems.
The first was that of keeping a characteristic Indian
silhouette on the screen at all times. The second problem
was that of varying his movements to show his
veneration for his chief and his adoration for the
Great Spirit. The beating of the tomtom gave the
tempo for the steps of his dance. A teacher who understood
folk dancing coached the boy who took this
part outside of the regular rehearsals, so that he might
gain confidence and skill.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='ic003'>
<p><i>More scenes from the human shadow play, "The Indian and the Oki."</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>By the fourth or fifth rehearsal, if the actors can
interpret their part naturally and convincingly, they
will be ready to put on their costumes. Here many
surprises await them. As an illustration of this the
shepherdess in the play by that name made, for herself,
a very correct little bodice. When she appeared
on the shadow screen her silhouette was very disappointing.
In order to give the right effect, a short
length of cheesecloth was slashed six or seven times
at the ends, and then drawn tightly around her, and
the slashed ends were tied together down the front.
You can see her in the illustration, as she kneels on
the bridge manipulating one of the fighting sparrows
in the first scene of <cite>The Indian and the Oki</cite>. The
long heavy braids of this shepherdess were made of
yarn.</p>

<p class='c014'>Any ordinary lantern or an electric light with a
reflector may be used for lighting the screen. A screen
7 by 12 feet will require a 400-watt light placed about
eighteen feet behind it. If you have very little space
behind your screen, your lantern may throw a large
disk of light. You can avoid this disk by fastening to
the front of the lantern a piece of asbestos with an
opening cut to the same proportions as the screen.</p>

<p class='c014'>There are many possibilities of using color in a
shadow play. A safe rule to follow is either to use
color throughout a play or not to use color at all. A
sheet of colored gelatine placed in front of the light
will diffuse color over the entire screen. The time of
day can be suggested by color: pink for early morning,
yellow for noon, yellow-orange for the late afternoon,
blue or blue-green for night.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the second scene of <cite>The Indian and the Oki</cite>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>yellow-orange gelatine was used to indicate the late
summer afternoon. Under the cardboard kettle a red
bulb, partly concealed by sticks and twigs, suggested
fire.</p>

<p class='c014'>The depths of the sea can be suggested by covering
the light with green gelatine and using cut-out shells,
seaweeds, and water plants as scenery. Water sprites
and fanciful sea creatures would be at home in such
a setting.</p>

<p class='c014'>Music is a beautiful accompaniment for shadow
plays, especially for Christmas and Easter celebrations.
Imagine a shadow play in six scenes built about
the Nativity according to the gospels of St. Matthew
and St. Luke.</p>

<h4 class='c015'><i>Scene I—The Annunciation</i></h4>

<p class='c024'>“The angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city
of Galilee, named Nazareth, to a virgin espoused to a
man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David;
and the virgin’s name was Mary. And the angel came
in unto her, and said, ‘Hail, thou that art highly
favored, the Lord is with thee; blessed art thou among
women.’” (St. Luke, I: 26, 27, 28.)</p>

<h4 class='c015'><i>Scene II—The Angel and the Shepherds</i></h4>

<p class='c024'>“And there were in the same country, shepherds
abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flocks
by night. And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon
them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about
them: and they were sore afraid. And the angel said
unto them, ‘Fear not, for behold, I bring you good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For
unto you is born this day in the city of David, a
Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. And this shall be a
sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in
swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.’ And suddenly
there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly
host praising God, and saying, ‘Glory to God in the
highest, and on earth, peace and good will toward men.’
And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away
from them into heaven, the shepherds said to one
another, ‘Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and
see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord
hath made known unto us.’” (St. Luke, II: 3–16.)</p>

<h4 class='c015'><i>Scene III—The Adoration of the Shepherds</i></h4>

<p class='c024'>“The Shepherds came with haste, and found Mary,
and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger.” (St.
Luke, II: 17.)</p>

<h4 class='c015'><i>Scene IV—The Coming of the Wise Men</i></h4>

<p class='c024'>“Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea
in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise
men from the east to Jerusalem, saying, ‘Where is he
that is born King of the Jews? For we have seen his
star in the east and are come to worship him.’” (St.
Matthew, II: 1, 3.)</p>

<h4 class='c015'><i>Scene V—Simeon and the Young Child</i></h4>

<p class='c024'>“And behold there was a man in Jerusalem, whose
name was Simeon; and the same man was just and
devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>Holy Ghost was upon him, and it was revealed unto
him by the Holy Ghost that he should not see death
before he had seen the Lord’s Christ. And he came by
Spirit into the Temple: and when the parents brought
the Child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the
law, then took he him up in his arms, and blessed
God, and said, ‘Lord, now lettest thou thy servant
depart in peace, according to thy word: for mine eyes
have seen thy salvation, which thou hast prepared
before the face of all peoples: a light to lighten the
Gentiles and the glory of thy people Israel.’” (St.
Luke, II: 25, 33.)</p>

<h4 class='c015'><i>Scene VI—The Flight into Egypt</i></h4>

<p class='c024'>“And the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in
a dream, saying, ‘Arise, and take the young Child and
his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there
until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young
Child to destroy him.’ When he arose he took the
young Child and his mother by night, and departed
into Egypt, and was there until the death of Herod;
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the
Lord by the prophet, saying, ‘Out of Egypt have I
called my son.’” (St. Matthew, II: 13, 11.)</p>

<p class='c020'>These incidents, so simple, vivid, and beautiful
when reverently interpreted as shadow plays, seem
to carry something of the age-old mystery of the
shadow.</p>

have already discovered their possibilities and are
even carrying the shadow into the world of the movie,
revealing new fields as a challenge to our creative
efforts.</p>
